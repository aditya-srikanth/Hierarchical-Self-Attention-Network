but O
the O
staff B
was O
so O
horrible O
to O
us O
. O

to O
be O
completely O
fair O
, O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food B
, O
which O
was O
above O
average O
, O
but O
couldn't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O
teodora O
. O

the O
food B
is O
uniformly O
exceptional O
, O
with O
a O
very O
capable O
kitchen B
which O
will O
proudly O
whip O
up O
whatever O
you O
feel O
like O
eating O
, O
whether O
it's O
on O
the O
menu B
or O
not O
. O

where O
gabriela O
personaly O
greets O
you O
and O
recommends O
you O
what O
to O
eat O
. O

for O
those O
that O
go O
once O
and O
don't O
enjoy O
it O
, O
all O
i O
can O
say O
is O
that O
they O
just O
don't O
get O
it O
. O

not O
only O
was O
the O
food B
outstanding O
, O
but O
the O
little O
'perks' O
were O
great O
. O

it O
is O
very O
overpriced O
and O
not O
very O
tasty O
. O

our O
agreed O
favorite O
is O
the O
orrechiete B
with B
sausage B
and B
chicken B
usually O
the O
waiters B
are O
kind O
enough O
to O
split O
the O
dish B
in O
half O
so O
you O
get O
to O
sample O
both O
meats B
. O

the O
bagels O
have O
an O
outstanding O
taste O
with O
a O
terrific O
texture O
, O
both O
chewy O
yet O
not O
gummy O
. O

nevertheless O
the O
food B
itself O
is O
pretty O
good O
. O

they O
did O
not O
have O
mayonnaise B
, O
forgot O
our O
toast B
, O
left O
out O
ingredients B
ie O
cheese B
in O
an O
omelet B
, O
below O
hot O
temperatures O
and O
the O
bacon B
was O
so O
over O
cooked O
it O
crumbled O
on O
the O
plate B
when O
you O
touched O
it O
. O

it O
took O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
get O
our O
check B
, O
which O
was O
perfect O
since O
we O
could O
sit O
, O
have O
drinks B
and O
talk O
! O

the O
design B
and O
atmosphere B
is O
just O
as O
good O
. O

he O
has O
visited O
thailand O
and O
is O
quite O
expert O
on O
the O
cuisine B
. O

i O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
mary's O
and O
am O
making O
it O
one O
of O
my O
regular O
neighborhood O
haunts O
. O

the O
pizza B
is O
the O
best O
if O
you O
like O
thin B
crusted B
pizza B
. O

my O
girlfriend O
and O
i O
stumbled O
onto O
this O
hopping O
place O
the O
other O
night O
and O
had O
a O
great O
time O
! O

he O
can't O
help O
, O
they're O
bought O
up O
so O
fast O
. O

secondly O
, O
on O
this O
night O
the O
place O
was O
overwhelmed O
by O
upper O
east O
side O
ladies O
perfume O
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
a O
handful O
of O
times O
, O
for O
no O
reason O
besides O
sheer O
convenience O
. O

obviously O
run O
by O
folks O
who O
know O
a O
pie O
. O

we O
were O
very O
disappointed O
. O

it O
is O
definitely O
special O
and O
affordable O
. O

i O
really O
liked O
this O
place O
. O

i O
will O
be O
going O
back O
very O
soon O
. O

all O
the O
money O
went O
into O
the O
interior B
decoration B
, O
none O
of O
it O
went O
to O
the O
chefs B
. O

the O
seats B
are O
uncomfortable O
if O
you O
are O
sitting O
against O
the O
wall O
on O
wooden O
benches O
. O

i O
asked O
for O
seltzer B
with B
lime B
, O
no O
ice O
. O

it O
was O
pretty O
inexpensive O
too O
. O

will O
not O
be O
back O
. O

don't O
go O
alone O
even O
two O
people O
isn't O
enough O
for O
the O
whole O
experience O
, O
with O
pickles B
and B
a O
selection B
of B
meats B
and B
seafoods B
. O

my O
suggestion O
is O
to O
eat B
family B
style B
because O
you'll O
want O
to O
try O
the O
other O
dishes B
. O

best O
of O
all O
is O
the O
warm O
vibe B
, O
the O
owner B
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
service B
is O
fast O
. O

this O
isn't O
a O
value O
joint O
. O

faan's O
got O
a O
great O
concept O
but O
a O
little O
rough O
on O
the O
delivery B
. O

from O
the O
incredible O
food B
, O
to O
the O
warm O
atmosphere B
, O
to O
the O
friendly O
service B
, O
this O
downtown O
neighborhood O
spot O
doesn't O
miss O
a O
beat O
. O

great O
food B
at O
reasonable O
prices B
, O
makes O
for O
an O
evening O
that O
can't O
be O
beat O
! O

look O
foward O
to O
trying O
the O
ruben O
upon O
returning O
. O

the O
only O
other O
steakhouse O
that O
seems O
to O
hold O
a O
candle O
to O
roth's O
is O
the O
strip O
house O
. O

we O
usually O
go O
to O
the O
chart O
house O
to O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
or O
anniversary O
. O

this O
little O
place O
has O
a O
cute O
interior B
decor B
and O
affordable O
city O
prices B
. O

you'll O
adore O
it O
. O

two O
words O
free O
wine B
. O

the O
price B
is O
reasonable O
although O
the O
service B
is O
poor O
. O

the O
quantity B
is O
also O
very O
good O
, O
you O
will O
come O
out O
satisfied O
. O

i O
have O
been O
to O
roth's O
twice O
and O
both O
times O
were O
very O
disappointing O
. O

worth O
visiting O
the O
1st O
ave O
spot O
because O
it O
is O
the O
original O
store O
. O

i O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
second O
floor O
walk O
up O
two O
fridays O
ago O
when O
i O
was O
with O
two O
friends O
in O
town O
from O
l O
. O
a O
. O
being O
serious O
sushi B
lovers O
, O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
sushi B
bar B
to O
be O
closer O
to O
the O
action O
. O

raga's O
is O
a O
romantic O
, O
cozy O
restaurant O
. O

the O
fried B
rice B
is O
amazing O
here O
. O

three O
courses B
choices O
include O
excellent O
mussels B
, O
puff B
pastry B
goat B
cheese B
and O
salad B
with B
a B
delicious B
dressing B
, O
and O
a B
hanger B
steak B
au B
poivre B
that O
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

it's O
a O
perfect O
place O
to O
have O
a O
amanzing O
indian B
food B
. O

the O
place B
is O
so O
cool O
and O
the O
service B
is O
prompt O
and O
curtious O
. O

at O
the O
end O
you're O
left O
with B
a O
mild O
broth B
with B
noodles B
that O
you O
can O
slurp O
out O
of O
a O
cup O
. O

i O
just O
wonder O
how O
you O
can O
have O
such O
a O
delicious O
meal B
for O
such O
little O
money B
. O

the O
food B
was O
delicious O
but O
do O
not O
come O
here O
on O
a O
empty O
stomach O
. O

the O
wine B
list B
is O
excellent O
. O

so O
garantuan O
that O
you O
can't O
fit O
them O
in O
a O
toaster O
. O

ive O
been O
to O
many O
thai O
restaurants O
in O
manhattan O
before O
, O
and O
toons O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
thai O
food B
ive O
had O
except O
for O
my O
mom's O
of O
course O
. O

they O
wouldnt O
even O
let O
me O
finish O
my O
glass B
of B
wine B
before O
offering O
another O
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
the O
sophia O
pizza O
. O

whem O
asked O
, O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
more O
detailed O
questions O
so O
that O
we O
knew O
what O
the O
specials B
were O
. O

this O
is O
a O
consistently O
great O
place O
to O
dine B
for O
lunch B
or O
dinner B
. O

nice O
atmosphere B
, O
the O
service B
was O
very O
pleasant O
and O
the O
desert B
was O
good O
. O

all O
the O
people O
that O
i O
bring O
there O
go O
back O
on O
their O
own O
and O
bring O
their O
friends O
! O

after O
really O
enjoying O
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar B
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table B
and O
had O
dinner B
. O

fabulous O
service B
, O
fantastic O
food B
, O
and O
a O
chilled O
out O
atmosphere B
and O
environment B
. O

not O
what O
i O
wanted O
to O
hear O
. O

try O
the O
lasagnette B
appetizer B
. O

pricey O
, O
but O
worth O
a O
try O
, O
at O
least O
once O
. O

i've O
been O
there O
a O
few O
times O
, O
and O
i O
usually O
end O
up O
sitting O
next O
to O
some O
pretty O
odd O
people O
. O

i O
liked O
the O
beer B
selection B
! O

great O
food B
, O
good O
size O
menu B
, O
great O
service B
and O
an O
unpretensious O
setting B
. O

go O
here O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner B
but O
not O
for O
an O
all O
out O
wow O
dining B
experience O
. O

can't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

i O
grew O
up O
eating O
dosa O
and O
have O
yet O
to O
find O
a O
place O
in O
ny O
to O
satisfy O
my O
taste O
buds O
. O

wine O
list B
selection B
is O
good O
and O
wine O
by O
the O
glass O
was O
generously O
filled O
to O
the O
top O
. O

with O
the O
great O
variety O
on O
the O
menu B
, O
i O
eat O
here O
often O
and O
never O
get O
bored O
. O

the O
menu B
is O
very O
limited O
i O
think O
we O
counted O
<number> O
or O
<number> O
entrees B
. O

if O
you O
are O
a O
carnivore O
, O
come O
hungry O
and O
you O
will O
leave O
more O
satisfied O
than O
you O
have O
ever O
been O
. O

the O
menu B
is O
limited O
but O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
dishes B
are O
excellent O
. O

not O
too O
crazy O
about O
their O
sake B
martini B
. O

great O
bagels B
, O
spreads B
and O
a O
good O
place O
to O
hang O
out O
in O
. O

the O
service B
varys O
from O
day O
to O
day O
sometimes O
they're O
very O
nice O
, O
and O
sometimes O
not O
. O

whoever O
the O
jazz O
duo O
was O
, O
they O
were O
on O
point O
. O

one O
thing O
i O
liked O
about O
this O
place O
is O
that O
i O
never O
felt O
rushed O
or O
pressured O
to O
give O
up O
my O
table B
ot O
incoming O
guests O
. O

this O
place O
is O
a O
great O
bargain O
. O

we O
happened O
upon O
this O
place O
purely O
by O
accident O
and O
were O
pleased O
with O
the O
results O
. O

unfortunately O
, O
the O
food B
is O
outstanding O
, O
but O
everything O
else O
about O
this O
restaurant O
is O
the O
pits O
. O

deff O
recimmend O
bukhara O
they O
also O
have O
opened O
two O
new O
locations O
guess O
ill O
try O
them O
out O
. O

we O
always O
have O
a O
delicious O
meal B
and O
always O
leave O
feeling O
satisfied O
. O

dip O
the O
ingredients B
in O
with O
your O
chopsticks B
, O
swirl O
them O
around O
, O
and O
eat O
. O

first O
went O
here O
to O
enjoy O
their O
garden B
terrace B
. O

my O
husbands O
was O
perfect O
, O
my O
was O
well O
done O
and O
dry O
. O

everyone O
i O
have O
spoken O
too O
there O
is O
super O
friendly O
, O
helpful O
, O
and O
willing O
to O
the O
extra O
mile O
for O
a O
customer O
. O

the O
pizza B
was O
pretty O
good O
and O
huge O
. O

sapphire O
is O
the O
only O
indian O
restaurant O
i O
go O
to O
when O
i'm O
in O
nyc O
. O

the O
cuisine B
from O
what O
i've O
gathered O
is O
authentic O
taiwanese O
, O
though O
its O
very O
different O
from O
what O
i've O
been O
accustomed O
to O
in O
taipei O
. O

i O
heartily O
recommend O
. O

heartland O
brewery O
is O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
best O
places O
in O
nyc O
to O
make O
new O
friends O
and O
catch O
up O
with O
old O
ones O
. O

i O
almost O
hesititate O
to O
write O
a O
review O
because O
the O
atmosphere B
was O
so O
great O
and O
i O
would O
hate O
for O
it O
too O
become O
to O
crowded O
. O

they O
are O
often O
crowded B
on O
the O
weekends O
but O
they O
are O
efficient O
and O
accurate O
with O
their O
service B
. O

all O
my O
co O
workers O
were O
amazed O
at O
how O
small O
the O
dish B
was O
. O

the O
atmosphere B
is O
unheralded O
, O
the O
service B
impecible O
, O
and O
the O
food B
magnificant O
. O

we O
ordered O
the O
special O
, O
grilled B
branzino B
, O
that O
was O
so O
infused O
with O
bone O
, O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
eat O
. O

the O
wait B
staff B
is O
friendly O
, O
and O
the O
food B
has O
gotten O
better O
and O
better O
! O

this O
place O
, O
which O
is O
only O
a O
few O
months O
old O
, O
is O
perhaps O
queens' O
biggest O
secret O
! O

it O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
packed B
on O
weekends O
, O
but O
the O
vibe B
is O
good O
and O
it O
is O
the O
best O
french O
food B
you O
will O
find O
in O
the O
area O
. O

this O
place O
is O
so O
much O
fun O
. O

i O
was O
glad O
i O
did O
. O

right O
off O
the O
l O
in O
brooklyn O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
cozy O
place B
with O
good O
pizza B
. O

i've O
never O
been O
treated O
so O
rudely O
. O

i'll O
be O
back O
soon O
. O

le O
pere O
pinard O
has O
a O
<number> O
pre O
theater O
menu B
that O
is O
outstanding O
. O

went O
inside O
and O
i O
started O
to O
get O
excited O
. O

i O
also O
ordered O
for O
delivery B
and O
the O
restaurant O
forgot O
half O
the O
order B
. O

our O
server B
checked O
on O
us O
maybe O
twice O
during O
the O
entire O
meal B
. O

however O
, O
it O
is O
jus O
too O
good O
to O
not O
praise O
it O
. O

we O
have O
been O
to O
montparnasse O
many O
times O
and O
return O
often O
for O
good O
reason O
. O

the O
strong O
scents B
coming O
from O
the O
left O
and O
right O
of O
me O
negatively O
affected O
my O
taste O
buds O
. O

we O
had O
the O
lobster B
sandwich B
and O
it O
was O
fantastic O
. O

it's O
somewhere O
you O
can O
eat O
and O
be O
happy O
. O

if O
you O
wrote O
a O
bad O
review O
, O
it's O
because O
you O
don't O
understand O
what O
rao's O
is O
all O
about O
. O

had O
we O
been O
stalling O
i O
could O
understand O
where O
they O
were O
coming O
from O
, O
but O
we O
had O
been O
there O
less O
than O
an O
hour O
and O
they O
hadn't O
even O
brought O
us O
a O
check B
yet O
! O

but O
overall O
i O
give O
it O
a O
<number> O

though O
the O
spider O
roll O
may O
look O
like O
a O
challenge O
to O
eat O
, O
with O
soft O
shell B
crab B
hanging O
out O
of O
the O
roll O
, O
it O
is O
well O
worth O
the O
price B
you O
pay O
for O
them O
. O

deep O
fried O
skewers O
are O
good O
and O
still O
rare O
to O
find O
in O
nyc O
. O

i O
have O
tried O
to O
make O
reservations B
, O
but O
both O
times O
, O
the O
hostess B
didn't O
have O
my O
name O
. O

i O
also O
recommend O
the O
rice B
dishes B
or O
the O
different O
varieties O
of O
congee B
rice B
porridge O
. O

their O
tuna B
tartar B
appetizer B
is O
to O
die O
for O
. O

this O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
restaurants O
i've O
ever O
been O
to O
. O

this O
restaurant O
used O
to O
be O
pretty O
decent O
. O

an O
oasis O
of O
refinement O
food O
, O
though O
somewhat O
uneven O
, O
often O
reaches O
the O
pinnacles O
of O
new O
american O
fine O
cuisine B
chef's O
passion O
and O
kitchen's O
precise O
execution O
is O
most O
evident O
in O
the O
fish B
dishes B
and O
soups B
. O

if O
you O
love O
wine B
and O
cheese B
and O
delicious O
french B
fare B
, O
you'll O
love O
artisanal O
! O

i O
love O
indian O
food B
and O
consider O
myself O
to O
be O
quite O
an O
expert O
on O
it O
. O

some O
baby B
pizzas B
get O
their O
wish O
. O

plenty O
of O
choices O
to O
make O
your O
own O
creation O
. O

it O
was O
tiny O
and O
i O
felt O
like O
i O
was O
eating O
in O
someone's O
living O
room O

i O
was O
there O
on O

the O
unaccommodating O

horrible O

late O
night O
when O

the O
last O
time O

in O
a O
corridor O
next O

with O
classic O
upscale O
italian O
decor B
. O

not O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B
. O

the O
entire O
dining B
experience B
was O
wonderful O
! O

the O
wine B
selection B
by O
the O
glass O
and O
bottle O
is O
wonderful O
and O
i O
always O
recommend O
that O
friends O
make O
a O
reservation B
if O
they're O
going O
to O
be O
in O
town O
. O

service O
is O
highly O
refined O
our O
seating O
was O
delayed O
<number> O
minutes O
past O
our O
reservation B
and O
the O
maitre B
d' O
apologized O
and O
regularly O
kept O
us O
apprised O
of O

. O

order O
the O
panang B
duck B
, O
it's O
fantastic O
. O

food O
is O
usually O
very O
good O
, O
though O
ocasionally O
i O
wondered O
about O
freshmess O
of O
raw B
vegatables B
in O
side O
orders O
. O

other O
than O
the O
crappy O
service B
from O
two O
individuals O
, O
it's O
great O
. O

what O
more O
can O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

wondering O
who O
had O
the O
best O
deals O
we O
noticed O
a O
line O
had O
formed O
to O
wait O
for O
this O
one O
particular O
establishment O
. O

they O
have O
authentic O
indian O
at O
amazin O
prices B
. O

you O
are O
treated O
just O
like O
royality O
. O

there's O
nice O
and O
quiet O
, O
small O
but O
enough O
for O
<number> O
or O
more O
. O

ambiance O
relaxed O
and O
stylish O
. O

i've O
never O
felt O
more O
unwelcome O
than O
last O
month O
at O
jimmy's O
bronx O
cafe O
. O

luckily O
we O
saved O
room O
for O
the O
bbq O
salmon O
, O
sea O
bass O
and O
crispy O
duck O
. O

yes O
, O
they O
use O
fancy O
ingredients B
, O
but O
even O
fancy O
ingredients B
don't O
make O
for O
good O
pizza B
unless O
someone O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
the O
crust B
right O
. O

looking O
from O
the O
outside O
in O
, O
one O
would O
hesitate O
to O
enter O
this O
hole O
in O
the O
wall O
really O
, O
that's O
what O
it O
is O
. O

and O
yes O
dal O
bukhara O
is O
so O
dam O
good O
and O
so O
are O
all O
the O
kababs B
. O

i O
look O
forward O
to O
eating B
here O
again O

i've O
been O
coming O
here O
as O
a O
child O
and O
always O
come O
back O
for O
the O
taste B
. O

tuk O
tuk O
is O
one O
of O
those O
comfortable O
neighborhood O
joints O
where O
you O
know O
you O
will O
always O
have O
a O
good O
meal B
at O
a O
fair O
price B
. O

a O
glass B
of B
leaping O
lizard O
, O
a O
glass B
of B
prosecco B
, O
and O
the O
mussels B
had O
everything O
happy O
. O

food O
was O
average O
and O
creme B
brulee B
was O
awful O
the O
sugar B
was O
charred O
, O
not O
caramelized O
and O
smelled O
of O
kerosene O
. O

the O
food B
always O
tastes O
fresh O
and O
served B
promptly O
. O

i O
know O
because O
i O
live O
nearby O
. O

the O
pizza B
here O
is O
delicious O
. O

my O
entire O
family O
was O
horrified O
. O

on O
a O
monthly O
basis O
my O
friends O
and O
i O
get O
together O
and O
have O
a O
girls O
night O
out O
. O

pizza O
and O
garlic B
knots B
are O
great O
as O
well O
, O
i O
order O
from O
them O
quite O
often O
and O
the O
delivery B
is O
always O
super O
quick O
! O

for O
great O
chinese B
food B
nearby O
, O
you O
have O
wu O
liang O
ye O
and O
grand O
sichuan O
just O
a O
block O
away O
. O

but O
who O
says O
murray's O
is O
anything O
about O
service B
. O

this O
place O
is O
really O
trendi O
but O
they O
have O
forgotten O
about O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
a O
restaurant O
, O
the O
food B
. O

i O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
in O
the O
red O
eye O
. O

hats O
off O
to O
the O
chef B
. O

this O
should O
have O
been O
done O
in O
a O
back O
room O
away O
from O
customers O
. O

service O
could O
be O
improved O
but O
overall O
this O
is O
a O
place O
that O
understands O
the O
importance O
of O
little O
things O
the O
heavy O
, O
black O
, O
antique O
seeming O
teapot B
, O
for O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
experience O
. O

glad O
you O
have O
the O
luxury O
to O
throw O
out O
paying O
customers O
. O

the O
pizza B
is O
delicious O
they O
use O
fresh B
mozzarella B
instead O
of O
the O
cheap O
, O
frozen O
, O
shredded O
cheese B
common O
to O
most O
pizzaria's O
. O

its O
an O
excellent O
place B
to O
relax O
and O
the O
food B
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city O
of O
new O
york O
. O

service B
is O
friendly O
, O
and O
never O
had O
a B
problem O
walking O
in O
and O
getting B
a B
table B
. O

the O
atmosphere B
was O
crowded O
but O
it O
was O
a O
great O
bistro O
type O
vibe B
. O

check O
it O
out O

first O
off O
, O
the O
waitress B
was O
completely O
unattentive O
the O
<number> O
times O
we O
saw O
her O
odd O
in O
a O
restaurant O
with O
<number> O
tables B
and O
got O
our O
order O
wrong O
. O

don't O
go O
. O

the O
food B
was O
bland O
oily O
. O

but O
they O
do O
. O

what O
is O
even O
better O
, O
is O
that O
the O
prices B
are O
very O
affordable O
as O
well O
, O
and O
the O
food B
is O
really O
good O
. O

the O
fish B
is O
fresh O
but O
the O
variety B
of B
fish B
is O
nothing O
out O
of B
ordinary O
. O

look O
i O
dont O
know O
if O
the O
people O
who O
wrote O
the O
reviews O
have O
ever O
been O
to O
a O
decent O
place O
please O
try O
someother O
places O
. O

suan O
has O
challenged O
this O
loyalty O
. O

our O
favorite O
meal B
is O
a O
pesto B
pizza B
, O
the O
house B
salad B
, O
and O
a O
good O
bottle B
of B
wine B
. O

and O
kruno O
, O
the O
beverage B
manager B
is O
the O
best O
bartender B
i O
have O
yet O
to O
come O
across O
. O

ambiance O
and O
music B
funky O
, O
which O
i O
enjoy O
. O

the O
food B
, O
drinks B
and O
service B
are O
clearly O
among O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city O
. O

i O
went O
there O
in O
late O
afternoon O
for O
some O
bite O
size O
food B
and O
refleshment B
with O
my O
date O
. O

it's O
a O
really O
great O
deal O
, O
considering O
we O
got O
full O
off O
of O
four O
dollars O
. O

i O
understand O
the O
area O
and O
folks O
you O
need O
not O
come O
here O
for O
the O
romantic O
, O
alluring O
ambiance B
or O
the O
five O
star O
service B
featuring O
a O
sommlier B
and O
a O
complicated O
maze O
of O
captain B
and O
back B
waiters B
you O
come O
for O
the O
authentic O
foods B
, O
the O
tastes B
, O
the O
experiance O
. O

went O
with O
mommy O
the O
only O
person O
who O
could O
afford O
taking O
me O
here O
. O

my O
friends O
and O
i O
were O
on O
vacation O
in O
ny O
and O
was O
referred O
to O
chance O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

last O
time O
i O
went O
here O
, O
the O
waitress B
didn't O
come O
back O
after O
taking O
our O
order O
. O

try O
the O
tandoori B
salmon B
! O

i O
am O
completely O
hooked O
on O
this O
place O
, O
it O
is O
ridiculous O
. O

eating O
in O
, O
the O
atmosphere B
saves O
it O
, O
but O
at O
your O
desk O
, O
it's O
a O
very O
disappointing O
experience O
. O

granted O
the O
space B
is O
smaller O
than O
most O
, O
it O
is O
the O
best O
service B
you O
will O
find O
in O
even O
the O
largest O
of O
restaurants O
. O

have O
recommended O
the O
place O
to O
friends O
, O
always O
gets O
good O
response O
. O

we O
will O
return O
many O
times O
for O
this O
oasis O
in O
mid O
town O
. O

i O
love O
the O
atmorphere B
peep O
! O

enjoy O
! O

we O
weren't O
! O

this O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
restaurants O
and O
it O
is O
not O
to O
be O
missed O
. O

la O
rosa O
is O
connected O
by O
a O
swinging O
door O
to O
the O
mexican O
restaurant O
pacifico O
. O

it O
could O
have O
been O
handled O
better O
. O

the O
service B
was O
attentive O
and O
her O
suggestions O
of O
menu B
items B
was O
right O
on O
the O
mark O
. O

the O
other O
night O
we O
had O
the O
<number> O
three B
course B
meal B
and O
everything O
was O
delicious O
if O
i O
could O
of O
licked O
the O
plate O
clean O
i O
would O
of O
. O

please O
be O
aware O
that O
it's O
cash O
or O
amex O
only O
! O

even O
after O
getting O
pushed O
out O
by O
the O
no O
class O
famous O
ray's O
, O
sal O
has O
risen O
again O
to O
carry O
on O
his O
father's O
uncle's O
legacies O
with O
a O
smile O
, O
true O
love O
for O
his O
community O
, O
and O
let's O
not O
forget O
the O
outstanding O
pizza O
! O

it's O
a O
rather O
cramped O
and O
busy O
restaurant O
and O
it O
closes O
early O
. O

the O
environment B
is O
romantic O
, O
but O
the O
food B
is O
horrible O
, O
the O
service B
is O
pathetic O
, O
and O
gabriella O
lies O
about O
everything O
she O
could O
. O

we O
had O
crawfish B
boiled B
and O
despite O
making O
a O
mess O
, O
it O
was O
a O
ton O
of O
fun O
and O
quite O
tasty O
as O
well O
. O

i O
had O
very O
high O
expectations O
for O
this O
place O
and O
made O
a O
reservation B
a O
couple O
of O
months O
in O
advance O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
. O

they O
were O
served O
warm O
and O
had O
a O
soft O
fluffy O
interior O
. O

what O
came O
to O
our O
table B
was O
burned O
beyond O
recognition O
and O
stringy O
. O

i O
had O
the O
pad O
thai O
and O
the O
noodles B
were O
sticky O
. O

so O
i've O
never O
actually O
been O
to O
m O
proper O
, O
but O
i've O
had O
it O
delivered B
a O
few O
times O
. O

among O
all O
of O
the O
new O
5th O
avenue O
restaurants O
, O
this O
offers O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
best O
values B
for B
your B
money B
. O

frankly O
, O
when O
you O
compare O
what O
you O
can O
have O
here O
for O
lunch B
, O
versus O
mcds O
or O
so O
many O
other O
sandwich O
shops O
in O
the O
city O
, O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O
. O

the O
hostess B
is O
rude O
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
offensive O
. O

if O
you're O
craving O
for O
haru's O
great O
food B
, O
especially O
the O
house O
roll O
, O
but O
can't O
stand O
the O
wait B
building B
outisde O
, O
head O
across O
the O
street O
to O
their O
sake O
bar O
! O

a O
narrow O
corridor B
leads O
to O
a O
tiny O
space B
where O
there O
are O
three O
tiny O
white O
tiled O
counters B
, O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
mess O
stacks O
of O
bottles O
, O
cans O
and O
a O
small O
counter B
holding O
<number> O
<number> O
entrees B
. O

the O
food B
is O
great O
. O

succulent O
steaks B
cooked O
precisely O
to O
your O
desired O
'doneness' O
accompanied O
by O
salads B
and O
sides B
that O
don't O
look O
like O
leafy O
road O
kill O
. O

lunch O
came O
with O
pickels B
and B
slaw B
, O
no O
extra O
charge O
. O

decent O
wine B
at O
reasonable O
prices B
. O

all O
conveniently O
delivered B
right O
to O
the O
door O
. O

even O
the B
wine B
by B
the B
glass B
was O
good O
. O

nice O
family O
owned O
traditional O
restaurant O
. O

would O
have O
rather O
tried O
terrace O
in O
the O
sky O
or O
water O
club O
for O
that O
price B

this O
dish B
is O
my O
favorite O
and O
i O
always O
get O
it O
when O
i O
go O
there O
and O
never O
get O
tired O
of O
it O
. O

i O
also O
ordered O
the O
change O
mojito O
, O
which O
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

okay O
service B
. O

the O
only O
thing O
more O
wonderful O
than O
the O
food B
which O
is O
exceptional O
is O
the O
service B
. O

we O
were O
very O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

the O
food B
was O
just O
awful O
, O
atrocious O
actually O
. O

i O
will O
never O
visit O
this O
restaurant O
again O
. O

the B
soup B
for B
the B
udon B
was O
soy B
sauce B
and O
water B
. O

the O
anti O
pasta B
was O
excellent O
, O
especially O
the O
calamari B
, O
as O
were O
the O
filling B
pasta B
mains B
. O

the O
waitress B
suggested O
glasses B
of B
wine B
that O
went O
very O
well O
with O
the O
food B
. O

or O
sister O
, O
in O
my O
case O
! O
. O

i've O
eaten O
at O
many O
different O
indian O
restaurants O
. O

they O
might O
be O
all O
business O
at O
the O
counter B
when O
you O
give O
your O
order O
, O
but O
their O
food B
says O
i O
love O
you O
. O

we O
are O
very O
particular O
about O
sushi B
and O
were O
both O
please O
with O
every O
choice O
which O
included O
ceviche B
mix B
special O
, O
crab B
dumplings B
, O
assorted B
sashimi B
, O
sushi B
and O
rolls B
, O
two O
types O
of O
sake B
, O
and O
the O
banana B
tempura B
. O

try O
their O
plain B
pizza B
with O
fresh O
garlic B
or O
eggplant B
. O

don't O
go O
there O
! O

ok O
, O
so O
the O
servers B
wander O
around O
a O
little O
clueless O
, O
but O
there's O
more O
than O
enough O
servers B
for O
the O
crowd O
they O
get O
it's O
fine O
, O
you O
just O
have O
to O
make O
a O
small O
effort O
to O
get O
their O
attention O
. O

good O
luck O
getting B
a B
table B
. O

we O
picked O
it O
randomly O
, O
without O
a O
recommendation O
from O
someone O
who O
has O
been O
there O
, O
so O
we O
weren't O
sure O
what O
to O
expect O
. O

don't O
look O
down O
your O
nose O
at O
me O
like O
that O
. O
. O
. O

planet O
thai O
is O
great O
! O

the O
service B
is O
awful O
. O

just O
don't O
do O
it O
. O

just O
ignore O
the O
trendy O
wannabes O
. O

the O
takeout B
menu B
says O
to O
keep O
an O
eye O
out O
for O
an O
expanded O
menu B
offering O
more O
italian B
dishes B
, O
i O
can't O
wait O
! O

trust O
me O
, O
it O
will O
be O
great O
, O
and O
all O
of O
it O
will O
be O
devoured O
in O
no O
time O
. O

my O
girlfiends O

to O
thai O
food B
, O
but O
my O
friend O
who O
took O
me O
there O
is O
. O

i O
think O
this O
would O
be O
a O
pretty O
good O
spot O
if O
it O
were O
not O
so O
overpriced O
and O
overrated O
. O

regardless O
of O
whether O
there O
are O
two O
people O
or O
two O
hundred O
people O
ahead O
of O
you O
the O
hostess B
will O
take O
your O
name O
and O
tell O
you O
five O
minutes O
. O

the O
pizza B
is O
good O
though O
. O

bottles B
of B
wine B
are O
cheap O
and O
good O
. O

you O
will O
not O
be O
disapointed O
at O
all O
. O

walk O
ins O
are O
risky O
too O
. O

the O
have O
over O
<number> O
different O
beers B
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
so O
that O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
and O
the O
food B
was O
delicious O
, O
if O
i O
must O
recommend O
a O
dish B
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin B
tortelini B
. O

they O
didn't O
give O
us O
the O
dinner B
special B
until O
we O
asked O
for O
it O
. O

you O
must O
have O
the O
crabmeat B
lasagna B
which O
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
the O
chocolate B
bread B
pudding B
for O
dessert B
. O

word O
of O
advice O
, O
save O
room O
for O
pasta B
dishes B
and O
never O
leave O
until O
you've O
had O
the O
tiramisu B
. O

very O
good O
service B
and O
very O
good O
prices B
. O

i O
recently O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
some O
co O
workers O
for O
lunch B
and O
had O
an O
amazing O
time O
. O

the O
service B
was O
impeccable O
and O
unobtrusive O
the O
staff B
knows O
what O
they O
are O
there O
to O
do O
to O
know O
their O
menu B
, O
present O
your O
meal B
, O
and O
attend O
to O
your O
needs O
. O

ess O
a O
bagel B
either O
by O
sty O
town O
or O
midtown O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
bagel B
in O
ny O
. O

our O
food B
was O
great O
too O
! O

open O
late O
well O
as O
late O
as O
i O
ever O
got O
there O
and O
i'm O
a O
night O
person O

the O
most O
annoying O
thing O
, O
though O
, O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
servers B
seem O
to O
be O
trained O
to O
drive O
revenue O
. O

get O
your O
food B
to O
go O
, O
find O
a O
bench O
, O
and O
kick O
back O
with O
a O
plate B
of B
dumplings B
. O

please O
try O
the O
filet O
mignon O
, O
its O
just O
the O
most O
tender O
piece O
ever O
. O

everything O
we O
had O
was O
pretty O
good O
, O
but O
we O
have O
only O
been O
there O
once O
. O

we O
were O
still O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar B
while O
we O
drank O
the O
sangria B
, O
but O
facing O
away O
from O
the O
bar B
when O
we O
turned O
back O
around O
, O
the O
<number> O
was O
gone O
the O
people O
next O
to O
us O
said O
the O
bartender B
took O
it O
. O

something O
about O
them O
being O
busy O
with O
holiday O
party's O
. O

the O
sake B
menu B
should O
not O
be O
overlooked O
! O

i O
would O
highly O
recommend O
. O

this O
place O
is O
great O
. O

the O
drinks B
are O
amazing O
and O
half O
off O
till O
8pm O
. O

i've O
been O
back O
to O
nha O
trang O
literally O
a O
hundred O
times O
for O
the O
beef B
cubes B
they're O
that O
good O
. O

with O
so O
many O
poor O
experiences O
to O
be O
had O
in O
the O
theater O
district O
, O
is O
truly O
an O
excellent O
find O
! O

this O
has O
got O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
overrated O
restaurants O
in O
brooklyn O
. O

the O
service B
, O
wine B
selection B
, O
ambiance B
are O
all O
outstanding O
and O
deserve O
recognition O
. O

went O
there O
last O
night O
for O
<number> O
year O
anniversery O
, O
and O
wasn't O
all O
that O
impressed O
. O

it O
was O
rather O
pathetic O
that O
it O
took O
them O
over O
an O
hour O
to O
seat O
us O
. O

we O
were O
seated O
promptly O
as O
we O
had O
reservations B
, O
however O
after O
that O
the O
service B
was O
slow O
. O

at O
first O
i O
was O
slightly O
skeptical O
because O
it O
was O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
nyc O
. O

it's O
really O
also O
the O
service B
, O
is O
good O
and O
the O
waiters B
are O
friendly O
. O

suan O
was O
a O
recommendation O
that O
i O
am O
glad O
we O
heeded O
. O

the O
food B
was O
pretty O
good O
, O
but O
a O
little O
flavorless O
and O
the O
portions B
very O
small O
, O
including O
dessert B
. O

we O
visit O
at O
least O
once O
a O
month O
. O

it O
is O
set O
far O
from O
the O
small O
street O
it's O
on O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
traffic B
noise B
. O

also O
, O
the O
place O
is O
popular O
with O
families O
, O
so O
if O
you're O
bothered O
by O
children O
running O
loose O
like O
wild O
animals O
, O
come O
later O
at O
night O
to O
avoid O
them O
. O

i'll O
keep O
this O
short O
. O

i O
felt O
as O
though O
i O
were O
eating O
in O
paris O
. O

lived O
in O
shanghai O
most O
of O
my O
life O
and O
thought O
the O
food B
was O
comparable O
to O
the O
flagship O
green O
bo O
restaurant O
there O
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
cafe O
st O
. O
bart's O
for O
their O
food B
, O
the O
ambience B
and O
wonderful O
service B
. O

however O
, O
it's O
not O
worth O
a O
special O
trip O
. O

nice O
value O
. O

gigino's O
in O
wagner O
park O
is O
so O
enjoyable O
. O

and O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important O
. O

this O
is O
a O
nice O
restaurant O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
place O
to O
host O
an O
intimate O
dinner B
meeting B
with O
business O
associates O
. O

all O
the O
nyu O
students O
love O
this O
place O
so O
it O
makes O
for O
a O
fun O
young O
atmosphere B
. O

the O
food B
here O
does O
a O
great O
service O
to O
the O
name O
cantonese O
that O
is O
. O
. O
. O
. O

but O
, O
nothing O
stands O
out O
about O
the O
cooking B
. O

joya O
used O
to O
be O
a O
cool O
spot O
with O
decent O
food B
and O
a O
colorful O
if O
not O
relaxed O
atmosphere B
. O

if O
that's O
a O
problem O
, O
go O
to O
mcdonald's O
and O
destroy O
your O
insides O
. O

the O
prix O
fixe O
menu B
is O
worth O
every O
penny O
and O
you O
get O
more O
than O
enough O
both O
in O
quantity B
and O
quality B
. O

i've O
been O
here O
<number> O
times O
for O
lunch B
and O
it O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorites O
in O
the O
city O
. O

i O
had O
their O
eggs B
benedict B
for O
brunch B
, O
which O
were O
the O
worst O
in O
my O
entire O
life O
, O
i O
tried O
removing O
the O
hollondaise B
sauce B
completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed O
it O
was O
. O

i O
work O
near O
by O
, O
and O
they O
have O
the O
best O
oatmeal B
in O
the O
neighborhood O
not O
a O
packaged O
or O
quick O
cooked O
item O
. O

always O
busy O
but O
fast O
moving O
. O

too O
bad O
the O
food B
wasn't O
of O
the O
same O
heritage O
. O

the O
menu B
looked O
good O
, O
except O
for O
offering O
the O
chilean O
sea O
bass O
, O
but O
the O
server B
does O
not O
offer O
up O
the O
specials B
that O
were O
written O
on O
the O
board O
outside O
. O

sexy O
. O

the O
food B
was O
really O
good O
, O
i O
had O
the O
onion B
soup B
and O
it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
ever O
. O

i O
will O
have O
to O
say O
, O
this O
bengali O
fast O
food O
joint O
is O
clearly O
my O
favorite O
. O

i'm O
not O
picky O
but O
it O
was O
actually O
gross O
. O

overall O
, O
a O
solid O
restaurant O
and O
at O
less O
than O
40pp O
including O
wine B
, O
a O
solid O
deal O
as O
well O
. O

since O
it O
literally O
is O
a O
complete O
hole O
in O
the O
wall O
, O
it's O
a O
bit O
intimidating O
at O
first O
, O
but O
you O
get O
over O
that O
very O
quickly O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
friendly O
staff B
welcomes O
you O
don't O
hesitate O
to O
ask O
for O
help O
with O
what O
to O
get O
. O

based O
on O
the O
reviews O
for O
dinner B
, O
this O
is O
a O
place O
i O
would O
reconsider O
revisiting O
for O
that O
, O
but O
definitely O
not O
for O
dim O
sum O
again O
. O

it O
costs O
<number> O
extra O
to O
turn O
a O
regular O
roll B
into O
an O
inside O
out O
roll B
, O
but O
the O
roll B
more O
than O
triples O
in O
size O
, O
and O
that's O
not O
just O
from O
the O
rice B
. O

even O
with O
john's O
and O
joe's O
around O
the O
corner O
, O
this O
place O
will O
make O
a O
name O
for O
itself O
. O

it O
melted O
in O
my O
little O
mouth O
and O
the O
perfect O
consistency O
not O
too O
fishy O
, O
creamy O
, O
and O
slightly O
buttery O
. O

when O
he O
finally O
did O
, O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
make O
a O
gin B
and B
tonic B
couldn't O
find O
tonic B
. O

my O
girlfriend O
convinced O
me O
to O
go O
in O
the O
other O
night O
for O
a O
quick O
bite O
. O

the O
dim B
sum B
is O
ok O
but O
doesn't O
taste O
that O
fresh O
, O
and O
the O
little B
dishes B
don't O
look O
steamy O
hot O
as O
they O
should O
also O
note O
lack O
of O
chinese O
here O
. O

despite O
the O
untasteful O
previous O
review O
. O
. O
. O

don't O
judge O
this O
place O
prima O
facie O
, O
you O
have O
to O
try O
it O
to O
believe O
it O
, O
a O
home O
away O
from O
home O
for O
the O
literate O
heart O
. O

sure O
, O
everyone's O
got O
their O
favorite O
, O
but O
to O
know O
sal O
, O
is O
to O
know O
new O
york O
. O

i O
think O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely O
brilliant O
and O
well O
runned O
business O
operation O
. O

also O
they O
were O
<number> O
each O
! O

the O
service B
is O
ok O
, O
some O
of O
the O
people O
didn't O
get O
what O
they O
asked O
for O
. O

my O
friends O
spoke O
so O
much O
about O
it O
for O
months O
, O
i O
finally O
made O
the O
time O
to O
come O
down O
ear O
and O
dine O
in O
. O

if O
you O
want O
good O
authentic O
thai O
this O
place O
is O
not O
the O
place O
to O
go O
. O

i O
recommend O
getting O
a O
reservation B
even O
though O
we O
saw O
people O
seated O
without O
one O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
moderately O
enjoyed O
was O
their O
grilled O
chicken O
special B
with B
edamame O
puree O
. O

this O
is O
as O
good O
as O
neighborhood O
restaurants O
come O
. O

if O
you O
want O
some O
roast B
duck B
, O
pork B
or O
chicken B
on B
rice B
with B
ginger B
, O
try O
them O
out O
! O

you O
order O
from O
a O
menu B
, O
so O
you O
leave O
feeling O
like O
you O
missed O
the O
full O
experience O
. O

one O
of O
the O
more O
authentic O
shanghainese O
restaurants O
in O
the O
us O
definitely O
the O
best O
in O
manhattan O
chinatown O
. O

we O
will O
go O
back O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
city O
. O

we O
love O
th O
pink O
pony O
. O

so O
eat O
fast O
and O
order O
a O
lot O
. O

staff O
is O
very O
accomodating O
. O

i O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
. O

eat O
club O
is O
a O
roving O
group O
of O
nyc O
gluttons O

if O
you O
were O
there O
when O
it O
first O
opened O
, O
give O
this O
restaurant O
a O
second O
chance O
. O

i O
went O
to O
del O
frisco's O
friday O
night O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
an O
<number> O
<number> O
reservation B
. O

if O
you O
like O
sakagura O
but O
you O
feel O
it's O
too O
much O
, O
you'd O
better O
try O
yokocho O
. O

yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
have O
dinner B
here O
and O
see O
if O
you O
dont O
agree O
with O
me O
. O

definitely O
a O
great O
spot O
for O
a O
nice O
occasion O
or O
date O
. O

you O
can't O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place O
. O

very O
popular O
style O
izakaya O
sake O
and O
small O
portion B
of O
sake O
friendly O
dishes B
. O

hurley's O
is O
like O
cheers O
where O
everyone O
knows O
your O
name O
and O
they O
are O
actually O
glad O
you O
came O
. O

not O
pretentious O
and O
very O
economical O
. O

the O
food B
was O
terrific O
and O
the O
service B
classy O
, O
attentive O
, O
without O
being O
overbearing O
. O

this O
is O
an O
amazing O
place O
to O
try O
some O
roti B
rolls B
. O

fresh O
ingredients B
and O
everything O
is O
made O
to O
order O
. O

we O
have O
never O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
charging O
the O
meal B
or O
the O
tip B
, O
and O
the O
food B
was O
delivered O
quickly O
, O
but O
we O
live O
only O
a O
few O
minutes O
walk O
from O
them O
. O

quick O
and O
friendly O
service B
. O

authentic O
bistro O
! O

they O
are O
tasty O
, O
but O
i O
suggest O
only O
eating O
one O
with O
meat B
because O
they O
tend O
not O
to O
mesh O
that O
well O
with O
the O
average O
american O
digestive O
system O
. O

somewhat O
pricey O
but O
what O
the O
heck O
. O

it's O
true O
, O
this O
place O
is O
not O
cheap O
. O

try O
the O
hot B
dogs B
too O
, O
they're O
snappy O
and O
delicious O
. O

delivery O
is O
fast O
too O
. O

being O
from O
the O
south O
, O
there O
aren't O
any O
good O
delis O
in O
my O
area O
and O
while O
watching O
foods O
across O
america O
on O
pbs O
i O
found O
out O
about O
katz's O
deli O
. O

the O
noise B
level B
was O
unbearable O
, O
conversation O
impossible O
. O

personal O
pans B
are O
the O
perfect O
size O
for O
those O
hungry O
nights O
. O

highly O
recommended O
is O
the O
spicy O
fried O
clam O
rolls O
and O
spider O
rolls O
. O

one O
of O
the O
earlier O
people O
commenting O
on O
the O
restaurant O
did O
not O
get O
the O
that O
some O
experimenting O
is O
going O
on O
with O
the O
menu B
in O
a O
positive O
way O
. O

it's O
convenient O
. O

thanks O
bloom's O
for O
a O
lovely O
trip O
. O

the O
atmosphere B
is O
great O
if O
your O
looking O
for O
a O
laid O
back O
scene O
and O
an O
inexpensive O
way O
to O
spend O
a O
weekend O
afternoon O
. O

oh O
right O
, O
i O
should O
probably O
say O
something O
nice O
. O

odd O
for O
ave O
b O
, O
not O
just O
odd O
, O
the O
place B
attracts O
an O
eclectic O
crowd O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

when O
we O
stumbled O
on O
leon O
, O
we O
thought O
that O
we O
had O
found O
quite O
the O
gem O
but O
, O
we O
were O
certainly O
wrong O
. O

instead O
of O
wasting O
your O
time O
here O
support O
restaurants O
that O
care O
about O
food O
. O

this O
is O
can O
became O
on O
e O
of O
the O
ny O
italian O
food O
fare O
institutions O
. O

just O
got O
back O
from O
lunch B
at O
tamarind O
and O
it O
was O
excellent O
. O

head O
and O
shoulders O
above O
its O
neighboors O
on O
east O
<number> O
st O
, O
taj O
mahal O
is O
also O
very O
comparable O
, O
in O
food B
quality B
, O
to O
the O
much O
overpraised O
and O
underdeserving O
baluchi's O
. O

the O
man B
that O
was O
hosting O
promised O
to O
save O
a O

for O
our O
party O

then O
sat O
a O

rosario's O

without O
a O
doubt O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
pizzerias O
in O
existence O
. O

decor O
is O
nice O
and O
minimalist O
, O
food B
simple O
yet O
very O
well O
presented O
and O
cooked O
, O
and O
the O
wine B
list B
matches O
the O
food B
very O
well O
. O

i O
had O
the O
salmon B
dish B
and O
while O
it O
was O
fine O
, O
for O
the O
price B
paid O
, O
i O
expected O
it O
to O
have O
some O
type O
of O
flavor B
. O

we O
ordered O
a O
tuna B
melt B
it O
came O
with O
out O
cheese B
which O
just O
made O
it O
a O
tuna B
sandwich B
. O

especially O
liked O
chicken B
tikka B
and O
the O
naan B
, O
and O
the O
dals B
. O

the O
waiters B
were O
not O
attentive O
except O
that O
the O
bill B
turned O
up O
on O
the O
table O
before O
we O
were O
finished O
. O

the O
restaurant O
looks O
out O
over O
beautiful O
green O
lawns B
to O
the O
hudson O

and O
the O

my O
wife O
and O
i O
always O
enjoy O
the O
young O
, O
not O
always O
well O
trained O
but O
nevertheless O
friendly O
, O
staff B
, O
all O
of O
whom O
have O
a O
story O
. O

we O
generally O
like O
good O
restaurants O
and O
eat O
out O
often O
but O
kai O
was O
way O
to O
expensive O
for O
what O
we O
got O
. O

what O
a O
great O
place O
. O

the O
sangria B
was O
pretty O
tasty O
and O
good O
on O
a O
hot O
muggy O
day O
. O

don't O
eat O
here O
unless O
you're O
starving O
for O
thai B
food B
and O
you O
work O
next O
door O
. O

this O
tiny O
williamsburg O
spot O
is O
always O
pleasantly O
surprising O
. O

for O
the O
people O
who O
want O
great O
food B
plus O
great O
service B
, O
roxy O
is O
a O
place O
to O
avoid O
! O

i O
had O
the O
best O
ravioli B
ever O
. O

while O
the O
menu B
isn't O
especially O
groundbreaking O
, O
everything O
i've O
tried O
so O
far O
has O
been O
well O
executed O
and O
tasty O
. O

ive O
been O
here O
a O
bunch O
of O
times O
now O
and O
the O
service B
is O
always O
outstanding O
. O

the O
bill B
is O
approximately O
<number> O
for O
<number> O
at O
lunch B
without O
drinks B
. O

quite O
frankly O
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi B
i O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

the O
food B
is O
great O
, O
service B
is O
ok O
. O

the O
overall O
price B
tag B
was O
very O
very O
expensive O
, O
something O
i O
did O
expect O
. O

by O
the O
time O
we O
were O
done O
, O
it O
was O
past O
<number> O
00am O
. O

spice O
is O
great O
thai O
food B
, O
love O
the O
inexpensive O
appetizers B
. O

read O
all O
the O
other O
review O
, O
they'll O
confirm O
it O
. O

even O
after O
they O
overcharged O
me O
the O
last O
time O
i O
was O
there O
. O

the O
service B
was O
attentive O
. O

he O
not O
only O
makes O
his O
own O
homemade O
mozzarella B
, O
but O
every O
pie B
is O
ultra O
fresh O
. O

fish O
was O
overdone O
. O

great O
idea O
and O
base O
for O
restaurant O
, O
but O
work O
on O
the O
details O
, O
people O
who O
think O
this O
was O
good O
need O
to O
go O
back O
to O
the O
shore O
towns O
and O
rethink O
what O
it O
should O
have O
tasted O
like O
. O

when O
you're O
sitting O
in O
their O
main B
dining B
room B
which O
has O
a O
spectacular O
, O
hand O
painted O
high O
ceiling B
you'd O
never O
know O
there O
was O
a O
world O
outside O
. O

we O
visited O
bread O
bar O
during O
january O
restaurant O
week O
and O
were O
so O
pleased O
with O
the O
menu B
selections B
and O
service B
. O

i O
have O
been O
twice O
to O
this O
restaurant O
. O

also O
make O
sure O
you O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O
music B
being O
piped O
in O
quite O
a O
weird O
selection O
. O

you O
could O
get O
a O
much O
better O
dining O
experience O
for O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
money O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
french O
bistros O
. O

the O
establishment B
scores O
big O
points O
in O
presentation O
and O
style O
. O

the O
rest O
of O
the O
dim B
sum B
, O
though O
pricey O
by O
chinatown O
standards O
, O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

good O
food B
. O

the O
wait B
staff B
is O
very O
friendly O
, O
if O
not O
overly O
efficient O
. O

surprisingly O
nothing O
could O
be O
further O
from O
the O
truth O
. O

the O
dim B
sum B
however O
was O
very O
good O
. O

it's O
better O
than O
being O
on O
the O
roof O
of O
sutton O
place O
with O
<number> O
year O
old O
interns O
jabbing O
you O
in O
the O
ribs O
all O
night O
. O

service O
has O
always O
been O
friendly O
and O
efficient O
. O

went O
there O
and O
had O
a O
combination O
of O
different O
seafood B
dishes B
and O
appetizers B
. O

its O
a O
great O
place O
for O
a O
casual O
date O
or O
to O
entertain O
clients O
for O
lunch B
. O

all O
we O
received O
was O
an O
apology O
as O
we O
left O
to O
see O
our O
show O
without O
dinner B
. O

the O
table O
next O
to O
us O
asked O
if O
he O
crushed O
the O
grapes B
himself O
when O
their O
long O
overdue O
bottle B
of B
wine B
finally O
arrived O
. O

prices O
are O
very O
good O
. O

we O
could O
not O
catch O
our O
waiter's O
eye O
, O
and O
he O
ignored O
us O
. O

fantastic O
place O
. O

plain O
and O
simple O
it's O
bad O
thai B
food B
. O

definitely O
not O
a O
restaurant O
to O
skip O
! O

they O
refuse O
to O
seat O
parties O
of O
<number> O
or O
more O
on O
weekends O
. O

usually O
<number> O
vs O
. O
<number> O
items O
per O
dish B
. O

while O
certain O
staples B
are O
excellent O
the O
burger B
, O
some O
of O
the O
pastas B
, O
the O
food B
is O
not O
really O
the O
point O
. O

the O
dim O
sum O
was O
so O
so O
, O
but O
not O
spectacular O
. O

the O
food B
was O
so O
so O
. O

the O
waitress B
, O
seems O
to O
be O
more O
concerned O
of O
looking O
good O
than O
actually O
waitressing O
. O

the O
place B
is O
larger O
than O
most O
and O
features O
adequate O
seating B
unlike O
most O
joints O
, O
and O
has O
a O
bar B
which O
deserves O
a O
mention O
. O

what O
a O
ripoff O
! O

threw O
my O
fiance's O
surprise O
30th O
birthday O
dinner B
here O
couldn't O
be O
happier O
. O

you O
can O
do O
it O
here O
. O

food O
awesome O
. O

good O
music B
, O
great O
food B
, O
speedy O
service B
affordable O
prices B
. O

there O
was O
a O
small O
wait B
, O
but O
shorter O
than O
i O
expected O
. O

the O
lobster B
sandwich B
is O
<number> O
and O
although O
it O
was O
good O
it O
was O
not O
nearly O
enough O
to O
warrant O
that O
price B
. O

may O
, O
the O
owner B
always O
has O
a O
smile O
on O
her O
and O
will O
warmly O
greet O
you O
. O

i've O
lived O
in O
ny O
for O
<number> O
years O
and O
this O
place O
has O
it O
all O
. O

i O
just O
read O
mocaramel's O
review O
and O
felt O
compelled O
to O
respond O
. O

the O
sides B
were O
ok O
and O
incredibly O
salty O
. O

it O
hits O
the O
spot O
every O
time O

for O
some O
reason O
, O
all O
the O
seafood B
on O
the O
menu B
was O
unavailable O
except O
for O
the O
salmon O
. O

not O
a O
large O
place B
, O
but O
it's O
cute O
and O
cozy O
. O

don't O
be O
fooled O
by O
crowds O
of O
people O
. O

and O
there's O
no O
way O
out O
. O

the O
beverages B
were O
excellent O
, O
and O
the O
dessert B
was O
good O
. O

the O
hostess B
and O
the O
waitress B
were O
incredibly O
rude O
and O
did O
everything O
they O
could O
to O
rush O
us O
out O
. O

next O
time O
, O
we O
wouldn't O
dare O
ordering O
anything O
else O
other O
than O
some O
simple O
asian O
appetizers B
and O
drinks B
. O

please O
if O
your O
thinking O
about O
it O
go O
, O
and O
stay O
the O
wait B
you O
won't O
be O
disappointed O
. O

i O
must O
say O
the O
view B
of O
nyc O
is O
so O
beautiful O
! O

if O
you'd O
like O
to O
have O
a O
nice O
light O
meal B
with O
an O
asian O
accent O
, O
long O
tan O
is O
a O
good O
place O
on O
the O
slope O
. O

when O
going O
out O
for O
a O
nice O
dinner B
, O
i O
like O
a O
nice O
ambiance B
as O
well O
as O
very O
good O
food B
. O

for O
all O
you O
lazy O
folks O
that O
don't O
want O
to O
come O
to O
alphabet O
city O
, O
i O
say O
, O
good O
stay O
out O
. O

otherwise O
, O
this O
place O
has O
great O
service B
and O
prices B
and O
a O
nice O
friendly O
atmosphere B
. O

highly O
recommend O
this O
as O
great O
value B
for O
excellent O
sushi B
and O
service B
. O

this O
place O
would O
be O
so O
much O
better O
served B
by O
being O
run O
by O
a O
group O
that O
actually O
understands O
customer O
service B
. O

a O
the O
service B
was O
good O
to O
excellent O
along O
with O
the O
attitude B
. O

this O
is O
my O
fourth O
try O
over O
a O
two O
year O
period O
, O
and O
i'm O
done O
. O

the O
food B
is O
awesome O
definitely O
try O
the O
striped B
bass B
. O

the O
music B
does O
get O
a O
little O
loud O
at O
times O
, O
but O
it O
just O
made O
me O
want O
to O
lean O
closer O
to O
my O
beautiful O
wife O
, O
and O
as O
i O
did O
, O
i O
got O
a O
whiff O
of O
corriander B
. O

black B
white B
shakes B
came O
out O
good O
also O
. O

it's O
simply O
the O
best O
meal B
in O
nyc O
. O

probably O
would O
not O
go O
again O
. O
. O
. O

after O
passing O
by O
this O
restaurant O
for O
sometime O
i O
finally O
decided O
to O
go O
in O
and O
have O
dinner B
. O

the O
seating B
was O
if O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
get O
the O
maximum O
amount O
of O
people O
into O
the O
restaurant O
, O
so O
be O
nice O
to O
your O
neighbor O
when O
you O
dine O
here O
. O

i O
ordered O
the O
chu B
chu B
curry B
and O
my O
friend O
ordered O
the O
pad B
thai B
chicken B
. O

we O
go O
on O
mondays O
for O
the O
prix B
fixe B
and O
our O
experience O
with O
the O
food B
has O
been O
comparable O
to O
blue O
ribbon O
. O

tuk O
tuk O
is O
my O
second O
favorite O
neighborhood O
thai O
place O
the O
first O
being O
joya O
. O

however O
, O
they've O
got O
the O
most O
amazing O
pastrami B
and O
the O
soups B
hit O
the O
spot O
. O

great O
bagels B
made O
the O
old O
fashioned O
way O
. O

this O
is O
some O
really O
good O
, O
inexpensive O
sushi B
. O

my O
personal O
favorite O
is O
an O
everything O
bagel B
with B
lox B
spread B
, O
but O
all O
the O
bagles B
are O
unbeliavably O
good O
. O

i O
wouldn't O
even O
have O
complained O
at O
all O
if O
the O
food B
at O
least O
tasted O
good O
but O
the O
quality B
of B
food B
was O
crappy O
, O
too O
. O

for O
the O
next O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
we O
stood O
in O
the O
crowded O
lobby B
area B
of O
this O
touristy O
restaurant O
listening O
to O
all O
types O
of O
explanations O
of O
why O
we O
were O
not O
being O
seated B
. O

the O
pizza B
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
proprietor B
is O
one O
of O
the O
nicest O
in O
nyc O
. O

also O
good O
for O
client O
lunch B
meetings B
, O
esp O
. O

for O
<number> O
the O
most O
we O
have O
ever O
paid O
not O
even O
waving O
a O
magic O
wand O
will O
ever O
get O
us O
back O
for O
a O
repeat O
performance O
. O

the O
decor B
is O
dark O
, O
cool O
and O
soothing O
, O
while O
the O
food's B
presentation B
is O
spectacular O
, O
considering O
the O
low O
prices B
. O

the O
waitstaff O
were O
very O
nice O
and O
suggested O
swordfish B
for O
my O
husband O
he O
enjoyed O
his O
meal B
. O

the O
setting B
is O
casual O
and O
romantic O
. O

it O
was O
horrible O
. O

terrible O
, O
terrible O
management B
deserves O
to O
be O
shut O
down O
. O

great O
friendly O
service B
, O
fast O
seating B
, O
fast O
delivery O
, O
excellent O
sushi B
. O

the O
desserts B
are O
more O
appealing O
then O
stuffy O
overpriced O
french O
restaurants O
. O

the O
italian O
food B
has O
flavor O
that O
can O
be O
sort O
of O
surprising O
on O
the O
ues O
, O
and O
the O
service B
turns O
from O
a O
nightmare O
to O
attentive O
, O
they O
sort O
of O
remind O
me O
of O
the O
ny O
yankees O
of O
the O
late O
90's O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
bad O
it O
look O
, O
you O
knew O
that O
there O
was O
a O
rally O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
. O
. O
. O

as O
many O
other O
reviewers O
noticed O
, O
your O
order O
is O
often O
slow O
to O
arrive O
this O
is O
particularly O
true O
in O
the O
evening O
but O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
during O
lunch O
time O
. O

i O
found O
the O
food B
to O
be O
outstanding O
, O
particulary O
the O
salmon B
dish B
i O
had O
. O

mizu O
is O
home O
to O
creative O
and O
unique O
rolls B
not O
to O
found O
anywhere O
else O
. O

the O
new O

times O
has O
reviewed O
this O
place O
three O
times O
already O
, O
you O
know O
it's O
going O
to O
be O
good O
. O

baluchi's O

solid O
food B
and O
a O
nice O
decor B
at O
reasonable O
prices B
. O

emilio O
, O
the O
owner B
, O
is O
often O
sitting O
in O
the O
front O
table O
greeting O
guests O
as O
they O
come O
and O
go O
. O

i O
have O
been O
to O
spice O
three O
times O
twice O
during O
lunch B
and O
once O
at O
dinner B
. O

moules O
were O
excellent O
, O
lobster B
ravioli B
was O
very O
salty O
! O

i O
came O
to O
this O
restaurant O
expecting O
to O
be O
surprised O
but O
left O
bored O
and O
overcharged O
. O

a O
cheap O
eat B
for O
nyc O
, O
but O
not O
for O
dosa B
. O

the O
atmosphere B
is O
noisy O
and O
the O
waiters B
are O
literally O
walking O
around O
doing O
things O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
. O

the O
seafood B
is O
amazing O
, O
there's O
a O
good O
wine B
list B
, O
and O
the O
ever O
changing O
menu B
always O
offers O
some O
great O
surprises O
. O

i O
don't O
usually O
order O
wine B
with O
indian B
so O
i O
can't O
comment O
on O
their O
wine B
list B
or O
their O
wines B
. O

pastrami O
or B
corned B
beef B
are O
juicy O
and O
piled O
high O
ask O
for O
extra O
rye B
bread B
. O

<number> O
for O
<number> O
glasses B
of B
champagne B
, O
not O
too O
expensive O
bottle B
of B

really O
though O
, O
where's O
the O
seasoning B
? O

the O
food B
was O
just O
ok O
, O
at O
least O
for O
what O
food B
was O
available O
. O

by O
dinner O
time O
, O
they O
turn O
it O
around O
and O
mount O
a O
huge O
comeback O
! O
! O

the O
waitress B
was O
very O
patient O
with O
us O
and O
the O
food B
is O
phenomenal O
! O

the O
ambience B
was O
nice O
, O
but O
service B
wasn't O
so O
great O
. O

solid O
wine B
list B
, O
knowledgeable O
staff B
, O
friendly O
owners B
and O
an O
adventurous O
, O
ever O
changing O
menu B
keep O
us O
coming O
back O
. O

the O
people B
that O
work O
there O
are O
always O
so O
friendly O
you O
forget O
you O
are O
in O
new O
york O
sometimes O
. O

we O
didn't O
even O
see O
a O
menu B
, O
as O
our O
waiter B
described O
both O
the O
specials B
and O
the O
main B
dishes B
. O

the O
location B
and O
ambience B
is O
ok O
but O
the O
food B
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

otherwise O
, O
good O
stuff B
for O
late O
nite O
eats B
. O

the O
dinner B
was O
ok O
, O
nothing O
i O
would O
have O
again O
. O

it O
is O
thick O
and O
slightly O
soggy O
. O

its O
not O
the O
same O
if O
you O
have O
to O
sit O
inside O
. O

i O
love O
and O
i O
know O
gourmet B
food B
by O
excellence O
! O

i O
plan O
to O
come O
here O
again O
and O
look O
forward O
to O
trying O
their O
assortment O
of O
bruschetta B
, O
panini's O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O

great O
people O
watching O
as O
others O
do O
the O
same O
to O
you O
. O

maybe O
it O
was O
just O
an O
unintentional O
mistake O
but O
i've O
experienced O
the O
same O
with O
other O
restaurants O
so O
i O
don't O
appreciate O
such O
practice O
. O

two O
people O
in O
our O
party O
felt O
like O
something O
else O
, O
and O
volare O
immediately O
obliged O
with O
two O
great O
dishes B
that O
were O
not O
in O
their O
regular O
menu B
. O

he O
offers O
subpar O
service B
and O
has O
no O
personality O
. O

the B
waitress B
remembers O
me O
and B
is O
very O
friendly O
, O
she O
knows O
what O
my O
regular O
is O
and B
that's O
the B
fried B
mini B
buns B
with B
the B
condensed B
milk B
and B
the B
assorted B
fruits B
on B
beancurd B
. O

i'm O
going O
back O
. O

diner O
food B
at O
bistro O
prices B
is O
a O
bummer O
. O
. O
. O
. O

my O
friends O
and O
i O
have O
been O
going O
here O
regularly O
for O
two O
years O
. O

wow O
! O
how O
have O
i O
missed O
this O
one O
, O
tried O
long O
tan O
last O
week O
for O
the O
first O
time O
and O
now O
know O
what O
the O
ny O
times O
and O
many O
more O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
already O
knew O
. O

go O
there O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
and O
leave O
feeling O
like O
a O
baby O
veal O
calf O
ok O
bad O
joke O
, O
but O
you O
will O
see O
. O

while O
we O
thoroughly O
enjoyed O
the O
food B
, O
it O
was O
annoying O
to O
scream O
across O
the O
table O
for O
conversation O
. O

me O
and O
my O
girls O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
. O

the O
first O
time O
the O
sushi B
was O
outstanding O
, O
the O
second O
time O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bland O
. O

the O
portions B
are O
large O
and O
the O
servers B
always O
surprise O
us O
with O
a O
different O
starter B
. O

delicious O
bagels B
, O
especially O
when O
right O
out O
of O
the O
oven O
. O

ive O
passed O
by O
the O
spot O
tons O
of O
times O
always O
wanting O
to O
go O
in O
. O

all O
the O
food B
was O
hot O
tasty O
. O

have O
been O
several O
times O
and O
it O
never O
dissapoints O
. O

this O
is O
one O
great O
place O
to O
eat O
pizza B
more O
out O
but O
not O
a O
good O
place O
for O
take O
out O
pizza B
. O

our O
server B
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
friendly O
. O

try O
green B
curry B
with B
vegetables B
. O

would O
recommend O
this O
place O
as O
a O
good O
date O
spot O
if O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
drop O
a O
ton O
of O
cash O
. O

while O
i'm O
not O
sure O
that O
this O
happens O
all O
the O
time O
this O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
treatment O
that O
buys O
repeat O
business O
! O

this O
place O
was O
not O
all O
that O
! O

first O
of O
all O
, O
this O
place B
is O
not O
romantic O
, O
as O
claimed O
by O
citysearch's O
editorial O
review O
. O

the O
second O
you O
walk O
through O
the O
heavy O
vault O
like O
door B
, O
with O
people O
anticipating O
your O
arrival O
you O
get O
the O
sense O
that O
you O
are O
going O
to O
have O
the O
dining O
ride O
of O
a O
lifetime O
. O

much O
more O
reasonably O
priced B
too O
! O

if O
you O
venture O
off O
the O
island O
of O
manhattan O
and O
can't O
seem O
to O
find O
a O
great O
italian O
restaurant O
, O
drive O
to O
corona O
. O

the O
food B
was O
not O
very O
tasty O
, O
the O
portioins B
were O
tiny O
even O
for O
such O
a O
high O
quality O
restaurant O
. O

my O
friend O
from O
milan O
and O
myself O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
when O
we O
arrived O
and O
everyone O
spoke O
italian O
. O

others O
have O
to O
go O
to O
other O
restaurants O
and O
feel O
sad O
until O
they're O
eaten O
. O

why O
make O
a O
reservation B
if O
you O
aren't O
going O
to O
keep O
it O
? O

the O
pad O
thai O
is O
excellent O
here O
, O
as O
well O
. O

big O
and O
gawky O
on O
the O
outside O
. O

i O
have O
been O
to O
mary's O
many O
times O
and O
i O
like O
it O
. O

searching O
to O
get O
out O
from O
the O
cold O
, O
freezing O
weather O
, O
we O
went O
into O
what O
we O
thought O
was O
a O
deli O
. O

i O
do O
not O
recommend O
lunch B
specials B
just O
because O
it O
tasts O
the O
same O
with O
other O
regular O
chinese O
restaurant O
. O

highly O
recommended O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

this O
is O
the O
best O
thing O
in O
soho O
. O

went O
here O
last O
night O
and O
had O
a O
pleasant O
experience O
. O

we O
parked O
on O
the O
block O
of O
nina's O
the O
place B
looked O
nice O
, O
with O
people O
obviously O
enjoying O
their O
pizzas B
. O

i O
came O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
because O
it O
was O
highly O
recommended O
to O
him O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

for O
<number> O
for O
<number> O
people O
, O
it's O
a O
once O
in O
a O
lifetime O
experience O
. O

the O
food B
is O
o O
. O
k O
. O
, O
but O
not O
any O
better O
than O
what O
you O
get O
at O
a O
good O
neighborhood O
restaurant O
. O

we O
had O
the O
pot O
stickers O
which O
were O
great O
and O
a O
tempura B
dish B
that O
was O
great O
. O

i O
think O
the O
stuff B
was O
better O
than O
disney O
. O

after O
reading O
the O
good O
reviews O
of O
this O
restaurant O
, O
i O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
with O
two O
friends O
. O

while O
the O
<number> O
entree B
range B
is O
not O
overly O
expensive O
, O
in O
new O
york O
city O
, O
there O
is O
definitely O
better O
food B
in O
that O
range B
, O
and O
so O
sapphire O
, O
despite O
it's O
lovely O
atmosphere B
, O
will O
most O
likely O
not O
be O
a O
restaurant O
to O
which O
i O
will O
return O
. O

orsay O
, O
is O
without O
a O
doubt O
one O
of O
the O
best O
values O
for O
authentic O
french O
food B
in O
nyc O
. O

i O
had O
been O
searching O
really O
hard O
for O
a O
restaurant O
in O
new O
york O
where O
i O
could O
really O
feel O
unwanted O
and O
ignored O
and O
i O
finally O
found O
it O
! O

it's O
definately O
not O
a O
place O
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
someone O
. O

well O
, O
their O
deliveries B
take O
for O
ever O
and O
the O
food B
is O
usually O
cold O
. O

the O
staff B
is O
no O
nonsense O
. O

chinese O
desserts O
are O
known O
for O
healthful O
benefits O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
sweetness O
. O

wonderful O
at O
holiday O
time O
. O

and O
really O
large O
portions B
. O

the O
place O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
. O

this O
is O
a O
great O
thai O
restaurant O
with O
a O
very O
friendly O
staff B
. O

have O
eaten O
at O
ginger O
house O
several O
times O
, O
and O
it's O
always O
good O
. O

i O
ordered O
the O
smoked B
salmon B
and B
roe B
appetizer B
and B
it O
was O
off O
flavor O
. O

we O
went O
here O
for O
lunch B
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
on O
a O
saturday O
, O
and O
i O
was O
thoroughly O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B
. O

i O
recommend O
the O
garlic B
shrimp B
, O
okra B
bindi O
, O
and O
anything O
with O
lamb B
. O

as O
a O
japanese O
native O
, O
i've O
lived O
in O
the O
tristate O
area O
for O
over O
<number> O
years O
, O
but O
i O
was O
just O
so O
amazed O
at O
this O
place O
. O

to O
give O
you O
an O
idea O
of O
how O
good O
we O
thought O
it O
was O
, O
we O
ended O
up O
going O
to O
ping's O
three O
weekends O
in O
a O
row O
! O
! O
! O

as O
we O
were O
leaving O
, O
the O
couple O
standing O
by O
the O
door O
said O
to O
another O
waiter B
, O
we're O
not O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O

the O
menu B
was O
impressive O
with O
selections O
ranging O
from O
a O
burger B
, O
to O
steak B
, O
to O
escargot B
. O

in O
fact O
, O
two O
people O
could O
really O
share O
one O
plate B
. O

the O
food B
is O
great O
and O
authentic O
. O

this O
was O
a O
repeat O
visit O
and O
we'll O
definitely O
be O
back O
again O
. O

during O
happy O
hour O
! O

good O
for O
casual B
dinner B
with O
jeans O
and O
sneakers O
. O

love O
yuka O
. O

anyway O
, O
the O
food B
is O
good O
, O
the O
price B
is O
right O
and O
they O
have O
a O
decent O
wine B
list B
. O

go O
, O
go O
, O
hurry O
, O
before O
everyone O
finds O
out O
about O
it O
. O

prices O
are O
higher O
to O
dine O
in O
and O
their O
chicken B
tikka B
marsala B
is O
quite O
good O
. O

i O
am O
bringing O
my O
whole O
family O
back O
next O
time O
. O

this O
place O
has O
many O
different O
styles B
of B
pizza B
and O
they O
are O
all O
amazing O
. O

the O
photos O
of O
the O
restaurant O
in O
its O
web O
site O
are O
way O
better O
than O
the O
real O
look B
. O

the O
food B
was O
lousy O
too O
sweet O
or O
too O
salty O
and O
the O
portions B
tiny O
. O

but O
the O
coconut B
rice B
was O
good O
. O

it O
took O
them O
<number> O
minutes O
to O
bring O
our O
appetizer B
. O

a O
guaranteeed O
delight O
! O

i O
have O
been O
coming O
to O
this O
neighborhood O
spot O
for O
years O
. O

overall O
i O
would O
recommend O
it O
and O
go O
back O
again O
. O

the O
food B
was O
great O
. O

pair O
you O
food B
with O
the O
excellent O
beers B
on B
tap B
or O
their O
well O
priced B
wine B
list B
. O

if O
you O
like O
your O
music B
blasted O
and O
the O
system O
isnt O
that O
great O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
pay O
at O
least O
<number> O
dollar O
bottle B
minimun B
then O
you'll O
love O
it O
here O
. O

all O
of O
my O
co O
workers O
stated O
that O
the O
food B
was O
amazing O
and O
wondered O
why O
they O
hadn't O
heard O
about O
this O
place O
. O

anyway O
, O
this O
is O
the O
last O
time O
i O
cross O
the O
williamsburg O
. O

metrazur O
has O
a O
beautiful O
spot B
overlooking O
the O
main O
terminal O
. O

friendly O
staff B
that O
actually O
lets O
you O
enjoy O
your O
meal B
and O
the O
company O
you're O
with O
. O

when O
i'm O
feeling O
stressed O
by O
the O
noise O
and O
congestion O
around O
my O
office O
, O
i O
head O
for O
cafe O
st O
. O
bart's O
. O

guess O
the O
555soul O
ads O
didn't O
launch O
her O
big O
modeling O
career O
. O

the O
restaurant O
is O
rather O
small O
but O
we O
were O
lucky O
to O
get O
a O
table B
quickly O
. O

besides O
, O
we O
were O
on O
vacation O
! O

i O
love O
this O
cozy O
around O
the O
way O
rest O
. O

quality O
of B
food B
is O
excellent O
and O
price B
is O
cheap O
, O
stick O
to O
pork B
, O
fish B
, O
chicken B
, O
lamb B
and O
vegetables B
. O

don't O
leave O
without O
trying O
one O
night O
in O
tokyo O
. O

save O
yourself O
the O
time O
and O
trouble O
and O
skip O
this O
one O
! O

this O
is O
my O
favorite O
italian O
restaurant O
in O
all O
of O
new O
york O
city O
. O

the O
place B
is O
a O
little O
tight O
and O
on O
a O
cold O
day O
, O
the O
seating B
by O
the O
entranceway O
can O
be O
pretty O
drafty O
. O

the O
appetizing B
is O
excellent O
just O
as O
good O
as O
zabars O
barney O
greengrass O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price B
if O
bought O
by O
the O
pound O
. O

but O
, O
they O
were O
too O
big O
for O
the O
bun B
. O

the O
food B
is O
fresh O
, O
delicious O
, O
and O
reasonably O
priced B
. O

raga O
stands O
out O
with O
an O
interesting O
fusion B
of B
french O
and B
indian O
cooking B
. O

a O
few O
tips O
skip O
the O
turnip B
cake B
, O
roast B
pork B
buns B
and O
egg B
custards B
. O

the O
bagels B
are O
fabulous O
. O

oh O
yes O
, O
and O
they O
lie O
on O
the B
phone O
, O
claiming O
they O
have O
seating B
in B
the B
garden B
, O
then O
of O
course O
the B
seats B
are O
not O
available O
. O

although O
they O
do O
the O
typical O
what O
kind O
of O
water B
would O
you O
like O
questions O
the O
service B
was O
good O
and O
overall O
very O
relaxing O
to O
place B
to O
eat O
. O

the O
food B
was O
very O
good O
, O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
and O
the O
place B
its O
self O
was O
great O
. O

the O
food B
options B
rule O
. O

a O
great O
choice O
at O
any O
cost B
and O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

anybody O
who O
likes O
this O
place O
must O
be O
from O
a O
different O
planet O
, O
where O
greasy O
, O
dry O
and O
tasteless O
are O
complimentary O
. O

we O
ate O
here O
in O
march O
, O
<number> O
and O
ordered O
the O
pre O
theatre O
<number> O
course O
dinner B
with O
wine B
flight B
. O

definately O
check O
it O
out O
! O
! O
! O

probably O
much O
busier O
for O
lunch B
, O
it's O
seldom O
crowded O
for O
dinner B
too O
close O
to O
downtown O
. O

their O
calzones B
are O
horrific O
, O
bad O
, O
vomit O
inducing O
, O
yuck O
. O

it O
takes O
forever O
to O
get O
a O
drink B
and O
they O
almost O
always O
forget O
to O
bring O
something O
although O
they O
dont O
forget O
to O
charge O
you O
for O
it O
. O

the O
place B
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar B
scene B
seems O
to O
be O
happening O
. O

saturday O

a O

good O

great O

selections B
and O
bagels B
really O
tasty O

a O
cool O
, O
more O
romantic O
bar B

. O
. O

authentic O
food B
and O
they O
have O
real O
service B
, O
not O
just O
the O

try O
to O
push O

out O
the O
door O
. O

stick O
to O
the O
gulab B
jamun B

i O
am O
amazed O
by O
the O
poor O
reviews O
i O
find O
this O
place O
to O
be O
standout O
italian O
in O
an O
area O
flooded O
with O
italian O
great O
prices B
, O
great O
atmosphere B
, O
good O
service B
and O
a O
wonderful O
wine B
list B
. O

i O
was O
back O
to O
back O
with O
the O
diner B
at O
the O
table B
behind O
me O
and O
wait B
staff B
had O
to O
hoist O
trays O
over O
our O
heads O
as O
they O
squeezed O
past O
us O
again O
and O
again O
. O

with O
the O
theater O
<number> O
blocks O
away O
we O
had O
a O
delicious O
meal B
in O
a O
beautiful O
room B
. O

i O
was O
a O
little O
leary O
about O
mary's O
at O
first O
it's O
small O
, O
crowded O
and O
you O
usually O
have O
to O
wait O
on O
line O
but O
i'm O
glad O
i O
finally O
tried O
it O
. O

we O
were O
not O
dissappointed O
in O
the O
least O
bit O
by O
this O
little O
gem O
. O

also O
very O
inexpensive O
. O

we've O
only O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant O
once O
, O
but O
we O
have O
ordered O
many O
times O
for O
dinner B
. O

i O
got O
enough O
reasons O
to O
keep O
coming O
back O
! O
! O
! O

by O
far O
this O
is O
the O
only O
chinese O
desserts B
place O
i O
know O
in B
ny O
or O
anywhere O
close O
in B
the O
northeastern O
america O
that O
serves O
desserts B
with B
frog B
jelly B
in B
a O
couple O
of O
varieties O
and O
pig B
feet B
ginger B
simmered B
in B
black B
vinegar B
. O

the O
food B
is O
great O
and O
reasonably O
priced B
. O

the O
characters O
really O
make O
for O
an O
enjoyable O
experience O
. O

i O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
sea O
if O
you O
like O
thai B
cuisine B
! O

over O
the O
years O
the O
host B
, O
vittorio O
, O
and O
his O
crew B
, O
have O
always O
treated O
me O
as O
family O
although O
with O
all O
the O
business O
this O
not O
so O
little O
gem O
does O
, O
it O
amazing O
he's O
even O
able O
to O
remember O
a O
consistent O
but O
not O
so O
frequent O
visitor O
. O

the O
restuarant O
itself O
is O
not O
large O
, O
but O
seems O
to O
have O
several O
round B
tables B
to O
accomodate O
large O
groups O
hoping O
to O
save O
a O
buck O
to O
eat O
authentic O
taiwanese O
. O

my O
husband O
said O
he O
could've O
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion B
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french B
fries B
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

you O
cannot O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place O
. O

it O
is O
the O
type O
of O
place O
to O
run O
into O
old O
friends O
and O
have O
a O
late O
, O
raucus O
dinner B
. O

the O
food B
is O
delicious O
from O
the O
specials B
to O
the O
regular B
menu O
fare O
, O
the O
dishes B
are O
never O
a O
disappointment O
. O

prices O
are O
in O
line O
. O

the O
combination O
of O
fresh B
tomato B
sauce B
, O
fresh B
mozz B
cheese B
, O
basil B
and O
the O
dough B
they O
make O
with O
imported O
flour B
, O
makes O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
better O
pizza's O
in O
ny O
. O

the O
food B
is O
prepared O
quickly O
and O
efficiently O
. O

and O
for O
this O
i O
had O
to O
shell O
out O
a O
small O
fortune O
? O

for O
all O
of O
you O
new O
to O
indian O
food B
, O
try O
the O
paneer O
roll O
, O
it O
is O
a O
piece O
of O
heaven O
. O

the O
food B
looked O
very O
appetizing O
and O
delicious O
since O
it O
came O
on O
a O
variety O
of O
fancy O
plates B
. O

both O
the O
fresh B
mozzerella B
slices B
and O
the O
plain O
cheese O
slice B
are O
phenomenal O
. O

i O
have O
tried O
literally O
every O
restaurant O
on O
curry O
row O
. O

the O
food B
is O
terrible O
and O
overall O
, O
i O
would O
have O
to O
say O
avoid O
at O
all O
costs O
. O

i've O
been O
to O
this O
monster O
sushi O
twice O
, O
the O
46th O
st O
once O
, O
the O
23rd O
st O
one O
a O
number O
of O
times O
. O

unfortunately O
, O
the O
food B
was O
not O
something O
to O
get O
worked O
up O
about O
. O

it's O
constantly O
open O
, O
catering O
to O
the O
pakistani O
cabbies O
lined O
up O
on O
crosby O
st O
. O
, O
so O
there's O
more O
turnover O
with O
the O
food B
than O
you'd O
expect O
i O
. O
e O
. O
, O
surprisingly O
fresh O
. O

i O
had O
filet O
mignon O
with B
garlic B
mash B
. O

i O
went O
at O
<number> O
<number> O
pm O
specifically O
for O
the O
pre O
theater O
menu B
<number> O
. O
<number> O
for O
roasted B
tomato B
soup B
with B
chevre B
, O
steak B
frites B
, O
creme B
brulee B
and O
it O
was O
marvelous O
. O

the O
waitstaff B
were O
attentive O
, O
polite O
and O
helpful O
an O
impressive O
feat O
in O
such O
close O
quarters O
. O

go O
inside O
and O
you O
won't O
want O
to O
leave O
. O

i O
loving O
bringing O
friends O
here O
and O
i O
do O
so O
every O
chance O
i O
get O
. O

the O
bread B
at O
the O
beginning O
is O
super O
tasty O
and B
makes O
you O
want O
more O
the O
pizza B
is O
delicious O
and B
comes O
in O
personal O
sizes O
, O
however O
be O
warned O
that O
the O
peter's O
favourite O
pizza B
with B
prosciutto B
and B
baby B
arugula B
is O
actually O
a O
margarite B
pizza B
with B
cold B
prosciutto B
and B
baby B
arugula B
on B
top B
, O
like O
a O
salad B
. O

yes O
, O
the O
prices B
are O
high O
, O
but O
i O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

the O
large O
selection O
of O
bruschettas B
, O
paninis B
, O
tramezzinis B
keep O
the O
palate O
from O
stagnating O
. O

have O
always O
found O
that O
the O
waiters B
will O
go O
out O
of O
their O
way O
to O
be O
helpful O
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
they O
are O
often O
busy O
with O
lots O
of O
diners B
. O

while O
this O
isn't O
classical O
restaurant O
fare O
, O
the O
chef B
has O
given O
new O
life O
to O
an O
old O
cuisine B
with O
some O
really O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
dishes B
that O
are O
genuinely O
indian O
without O
being O
heavy O
or O
same O
old O
restaurant O
burn O
outs O
. O

the O
owner B
truly O
caters O
to O
all O
your O
needs O
. O

he O
takes O
real O
pride O
in O
his O
food B
and O
his O
business O
. O

every O
time O
in O
new O
york O
i O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
visit O
restaurant O
saul O
on O
smith O
street O
. O

my O
boyfriend O
and O
i O
went O
there O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
the O
other O
night O
and O
all O
i O
can O
say O
is O
that O
it O
was O
magnificent O
. O

so O
if O
you O
want O
a O
nice O
, O
enjoyable O
meal B
at O
montparnasse O
, O
go O
early O
for O
the O
pre O
theater O
prix O
fixe O
. O

over O
the O
years O
, O
it O
has O
always O
provided O
a O
pleasurable O
dining B
experience O
with O
quality O
food B
and O
wine B
. O

i O
would O
go O
back O
tho O
. O

the O
photobook O
menu B
was O
a O
cute O
touch O
, O
certainly O
helped O
my O
group O
and O
i O
pick O
the O
fried B
chicken B
, O
pork B
chop B
, O
and O
noodle B
dishes B
that O
we O
all O
ordered O
. O

too O
large O
for O
just O
two O
people O
but O
nothing O
was O
left O
. O

i O
cannot O
imagine O
better O
indian O
food B
in O
all O
of O
the O
city O
. O

great O
romantic O
place B
for O
a O
date O
try O
to O
get O
the O
corner B
booth B
table B
for O
a O
little O
privacy B
and O
to O
sit O
close O
! O
. O

a O
pleasant O
surprise O
. O

i O
asked O
for O
an O
open B
faced B
cheese B
sandwich B
and O
the O
manager B
basically O
told O
me O
to O
take O
my O
business O
elsewhere O
! O

if O
you O
don't O
mind O
all O
that O
noise O
then O
go O
to O
the O
chart O
house O
. O

we O
got O
most O
of O
it O
back O
at O
home O
with O
us O
. O

get O
there O
before O
7pm O
. O

very O
good O
breads B
as O
well O
. O

if O
this O
happens O
, O
just O
ask O
for O
real O
naan B
. O

we O
were O
fans O
of O
the O
half O
price O
saturday O
night B
option B
until O
some O
inedible O
squid B
during O
a O
recent O
visit O
. O

so O
, O
if O
yo O
really O
don't O
care O
who O
is O
sittingnext O
to O
you O
, O
which O
is O
about O
<number> O
inches O
away O

i O
would O
say O

it O
. O

pizza O
is O
terrific O
, O
as O

homemade B
pasta B
. O

definitely O
a O
neighborhood O
favorite O
. O

this O
is O
a O
wonderful O
place O
on O
all O
stand O
points O
especially O
value B
ofr B
money B
. O

my O
first O
encounter O
happened O
one O
friday O

is O
the O

which O
was O
about O
<number> O
oz O

and O
the O
mushrooms B
where O
<number> O

about O
1oz O

not O
exactly O
five O
star O
, O
but O
thats O
not O
really O
a O
big O
deal O
. O

there O
are O
other O
people O
waiting B
! O

from O
beginning B
appetizers B
, O
the O
scallops B

incredible O
, O
to O
the O
delicious O
chocolate B
souffle B
with B
rasberry B
mint B
sorbet B
, O
we O
were O
delighted O
by O
the O

. O

my O
goodness O
, O
everything O
from O
the O
fish B
to O
the O
rice B
to O
the O
seaweed B
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
. O

this O
place O
started O
off O
a O
little O
iffy O
, O
but O
is O
now O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
indian O
restaurants O
in O
nyc O
and O
i'm O
indian O

. O

i O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
a O
woman O
that O
i O
met O
recently O
. O

the O
dishes B
offered O
were O
unique O
, O
very O
tasty O
and O
fresh O
from O
the O
lamb B
sausages B
, O
sardines B
with B
biscuits B
, O
large B
whole B
shrimp B
to O
the O
amazing O
pistachio B
ice B
cream B
the O
best O
and O
freshest O
i've O
ever O
had O
. O

this O
is O
where O
the O
aforementioned O
line O
was O
. O

the O
food B
is O
reliable O
and O
the O
price B
is O
moderate O
. O

aside O
from O
the O
bearded O
, O
courdoroy O
blazer O
professor O
type O
with O
the O
nyu O
student O
he's O
sleeping O
with O
that O
week O
, O
you O
see O
a O
strange O
mix O
of O
hipsters O
, O
frat O
boys O
, O
will O
smith O
types O
who O
need O
to O
be O
told O
they O
are O
black O
, O
bitter O
cougars O
who O
cant O
understand O
why O
they O
arent O
married O
yet O
. O
. O
. O
. O

while O
the O
ambiance B
and O
atmosphere B
were O
great O
, O
the O
food B
and O
service B
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

we O
always O
go O
there O
on O
the O
weekends O
and O
leave O
extremely O
full O
and O
satisfied O
. O

i O
dont O
how O
this O
place O
is O
still O
running O
. O

the O
server B
was O
really O
cool O
and O
served B
us O
our O
food B
and O
drinks B
with O
a O
smile O
. O

we O
were O
in O
search O
of O
food B
and O
stumbled O
on O
this O
block O
of O
indian O
restaurants O
on O
east O
sixth O
street O
. O

planet O
thailand O
has O
always O
been O
a O
hit O
with O
me O
, O
i O
go O
there O
usually O
for O
the O
sushi B
, O
which O
is O
great O
, O
the O
thai B
food B
is O
excellent O
too O
. O

very O
excited O
to O
hear O
that O
short O
term O
chef O
jason O
narone O
has O
moved O
on O
, O
he O
truly O
was O
a O
low O
point O
of O
their O
sterling O
track O
record O
. O

excellent O
experience O
. O

well O
worth O
the O
trip O
, O
close O
to O
city O
hall O
and O
downtown O
subway O
stops O
. O

i O
had O
to O
share O
my O
table B
with O
a O
loud O
group O
of O
kids O
and O
the O
service B
was O
rude O
an O
unattentive O
. O

what O
more O
could O
you O
want O
? O

if O
you O
are O
the O
type O
of O
person O
who O
likes O
being O
scared O
and O
entertained O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
go O
and O
eat O
. O

all O
in O
all O
, O
i O
don't O
see O
how O
you O
can O
go O
wrong O
. O

the B
sauce B
on B
the B
pizza B
is O
sooo O
good O
with O
garlic B
and O
fresh B
tomatoes B
and O
they O
don't O
skimp O
. O

we O
recently O
decided O
to O
try O
this O
location O
, O
and O
to O
our O
delight O
, O
they O
have O
outdoor B
seating B
, O
perfect O
since O
i O
had O
my O
yorkie O
with O
me O
. O

my O
husband O
had O
the O
mesclun B
, O
salmon B
, O
and O
ice B
cream B
and O
he O
enjoyed O
all O
<number> O
courses B
. O

we O
were O
told O
that O
the O
wait B
was O
about O
twenty O
minutes O
and O
there O
would O
be O
no O
problem O
for O
our O
<number> O
<number> O
pm O
curtain O
call O
. O

the O
food B
is O
usually O
good O
but O
it O
certainly O
isn't O
a O
relaxing O
place B
to O
go O
. O

i'm O
told O
that O
it O
is O
open O
24hrs O
which O
is O
good O
. O

super O
friendly O
and O
knowledgable O
staff B
, O
fabulous O
bistro B
fare B
and O
a O
wonderful O
jazz B
brunch B
with O
great O
live B
jazz B
the O
chilaquiles B
were O
awesome O
! O

the O
prices B
were O
fantastic O
. O

what O
a O
great O
place O
! O

still O
, O
any O
quibbles O
about O
the O
bill B
were O
off O
set O
by O
the O
pour O
your O
own O
measures B
of B
liquers B
which O
were O
courtesey O
of B
the O
house O
. O
. O
. O

the O
table B
service B
could O
have O
been O
a O
little O
more O
attentive O
but O
as O
someone O
who O
also O
works O
in O
the O
service B
industry O
, O
i O
understood O
they O
were O
busy O
. O

it's O
not O
mind O
blowing O
, O
but O
to O
me O
, O
thai B
food B
never O
is O
and O
never O
will O
be O
. O

food O
was O
very O
good O
as O
well O
, O
considering O
that O
we O
tried O
the O
budget O
selection O
though O
i O
wish O
the O
pork B
belly B
that O
i O
ordered O
was O
roasted O
a O
bit O
longer O
, O
so O
that O
fat B
was O
more O
of O
a O
melt O
in O
your O
mouth O
experience O
. O

although O
, O
one O
night O
we O
went O
it O
was O
super O
cheesy O
, O
and O
another O
night O
it O
was O
less O
cheesy O
. O

even O
though O
it O
is O
a O
little O
loud O
, O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
yell O
at O
each O
other O
to O
talk O
. O

i've O
been O
to O
sapphire O
twice O
and O
both O
times O
the O
food B
was O
fine O
, O
if O
not O
good O
. O

it O
is O
kinda O
nosiy O
and O
the O
tables B
are O
close O
together O
but O
it's O
still O
a O
beautiful O
place B
to O
enjoy O
a O
nice O
dinner B
. O

was O
surprisingly O
disappointed O
. O

i O
love O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
pizza B
tastes O
so O
good O
and O
is O
so O
cheap O
. O

nicky O
the O
nose O
at O
the O
bar B
is O
a O
treat O
. O

i O
went O
to O
ruby O
foo's O
after O
work O
with O
a O
group O
of O
<number> O
. O

i'm O
amazed O
we O
haven't O
been O
kicked O
out O
of O
this O
place O
yet O
. O

service O
was O
prompt O
, O
friendly O
and O
great O
. O

i O
haven't O
eat O
a O
lamb B
chop B
as O
delicious O
as O
that O
, O
the O
salads B
are O
really O
nice O
dressed O
with O
lemon B
and O
extra B
virgnin B
olive B
oil B
. O

the O
sushi B
was O
awful O
! O

katz's O
has O
been O
a O
nyc O
original O
for O
over O
<number> O
years O
. O

you O
can O
get O
an O
excellent O
meal B
at O
most O
of O
the O
many O
indian O
restaurants O
on O
nearby O
lexington O
avenue O
for O
the O
cost B
of O
one O
the O
dainty O
dishes B
here O
. O

the O
pastrami O
sandwich B
was O
like O
buttah O
and O
with O
pickles B
and O
an O
icy O
cold O
beer B
to O
wash O
it O
down O
, O
it O
was O
a O
pleasurable O
experience O
. O

the O
plain B
pizza B
was O
soggy O
and O
the O
creative O
wild B
mushroom O
third O
generation O
fornini O
pizza B
we O
had O
was O
drenched O
with O
truffle B
oil B
in O
the O
middle O
again O
making O
it O
soggy O
and O
nothingon O
the O
rest O
. O

late O
nite O
omelletes B
are O
not O
good O
here O
, O
there O
is O
no O
variety O
! O

everything O
at O
sala O
thai O
is O
tasty O
and O
well O
portioned O
. O

after O
all O
that O
, O
they O
complained O
to O
me O
about O
the O
small O
tip B
. O

it's O
a O
great O
place O
to O
pick O
up O
a O
cheap O
lunch B
or O
dinner B
. O

behind O
this O
counter B
, O
two O
men O
are O
squeezed O
in O
. O

great O
find O
! O
! O
! O

if O
only O
they O
delivered O
, O
they'd O
make O
a O
mint O
! O

whenever O
you O
need O
a O
sushi O
fix B
, O
mizu O
will O
be O
there O
with O
quality O
fish B
and O
great O
service B
. O

our O
waitress B
was O
sweet O
and O
accomodating O
, O
not O
overbearing O
. O

went O
there O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
table B
even O
though O
you O
could O
see O
there O
many O
that O
were O
empty O
with O
not O
reservation B
sigh B
on O
them O
. O

i O
was O
really O
disappointed O
ant O
wanted O
to O
tell O
everyone O
not O
to O
go O
eat O
or O
even O
take O
out O
food B
from O
there O
. O

the O
website O
and O
rating O
makes O
this O
place B
look O
wonderful O
but O
in O
reality O
it O
was O
very O
disappointing O
. O

despite O
a O
slightly O
limited O
menu B
, O
everything O
prepared O
is O
done O
to O
perfection O
, O
ultra O
fresh O
and O
a O
work O
of O
food B
art B
. O

the O
outdoor B
atmosphere B
of O
sitting O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
watching O
the O
world O
go O
by O
<number> O
feet O
away O
on O
6th O
avenue O
on O
a O
cool O
evening O
was O
wonderful O
. O

a O
large O
is O
<number> O
, O
and O
toppings B
are O
about O
<number> O
each O
. O

in O
any O
event O
, O
this O
is O
a O
place O
i'll O
be O
sure O
to O
stop O
by O
again O
when O
i'm O
in O
this O
part O
of O
town O
. O

i O
definitely O
wouldn't O
go O
back O
. O

it O
is O
not O
worth O
for O
that O
bucks O
. O

brick O
oven O
gallery O
is O
my O
pick O
for O
best O
pizza B
restaurant O
anywhere O
. O

add O
to O
that O
great O
service B
and O
great O
food B
at O
a O
reasonable O
price B
and O
you O
have O
yourself O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
great O
evening O
. O

for O
many O
people O
, O
this O
may O
not O
seem O
like O
aunthentic O
thai O
food B
because O
most O
places O
in O
nyc O
arent O
quite O
authentic O
. O

growing O
up O
in O
ny O
, O
i O
have O
eaten O
my O
share O
of O
bagels B
. O

oh O
, O
don't O
even O
let O
me O
start O
with O
how O
expensive O
the O
bills B
were O
! O

a O
hearty O
two O
thumbs O
up O
! O

the O
scallion B
pancakes B
and O
fried B
dumplings B
were O
nothing O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
. O

all O
the O
appetizers B
and O
salads B
were O
fabulous O
, O
the O
steak B
was O
mouth O
watering O
and O
the O
pasta B
was O
delicious O
! O
! O
! O

besides O
having O
the O
table B
we O
had O
been O
promised O
given O
to O
other O
restaurant O
patrons O
twice O
before O
we O
were O
actually O
seated O
, O
we O
were O
served B
dishes B
we O
hadn't O
ordered O
three O
times O
, O
received O
one O
of O
our O
orders O
<number> O
minutes O
after O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
table B
had O
been O
served B
and O
that O
order O
was O
undercooked O
, O
and O
charged O
<number> O
more O
than O
we O
should O
have O
been O
on O
our O
bill B
. O

service O
is O
top O
notch O
. O

the O
food B
now O
is O
inconsistent O
. O

all O
pretty O
good O
. O

you O
can O
also O
special O
order O
any O
kind O
of O
dumpling B
, O
etc O
. O

you O
guys O
rock O
. O

chance O
is O
a O
joke O
. O

i O
was O
pretty O
much O
full O
after O
our O
fondue B
appetizer B
. O

be O
careful O
before O
you O
request O
extra O
spice B
. O

the O
octopus O
eaters O
were O
floored O
by O
the O
octopus O
salad B
. O

we O
thought O
that O
this O
place O
is O
using O
too O
much O
of O
msg O
cooking B
in O
the O
foods B
. O

i O
was O
at O
rao's O
last O
wed O
. O

and O
the O
tom O
kha O
soup B
was O
pathetic O
. O

i O
started O
out O
with O
a O
bombay O
beer B
which O
was O
big O
enough O
for O
two O
. O

the O
decor B
is O
vibrant O
and O
eye O
pleasing O
with O
several O
semi O
private O
boths B
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
dining B
hall B
, O
which O
are O
great O
for O
a O
date O
. O

service O
was O
quick O
. O

tends O
to O
turn O
people O
away O
. O

we O
thought O
this O
a O
prelude O
to O
what O
the O
evening O
will O
be O
like O
. O

i O
was O
turned O
on O
to O
this O
restaurant O
by O
a O
fellow O
foodie O
friend O
of O
mine O
, O
and O
have O
been O
going O
back O
regularly O
ever O
since O
. O

drawbacks O
service B
is O
slow O
and O
they O
don't O
toast O
! O

went O
there O
for O
an O
office B
lunch B
. O

i O
have O
been O
doing O
all O
of O
the O
above O
at O
the O
heartland O
brewery O
for O
over O
<number> O
years O
now O
and O
i O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
! O

everytime O
i O
decide O
to O
try O
another O
place O
on O
the O
ues O
, O
i O
get O
angry O
that O
i O
didn't O
just O
go O
to O
zucchero O
pomodori O
. O

the O
sweet B
lassi B
was O
excellent O
as O
was O
the O
lamb B
chettinad B
and O
the O
garlic B
naan B
but O
the O
rasamalai B
was O
forgettable O
. O

we've O
been O
following O
chef B
lyle's O
food B
around O
new O
york O
for O
<number> O
years O
and O
while O
remaining O
classic O
, O
his O
innovations O
with O
bistro B
fare B
have O
made O
us O
return O
and O
return O
. O

the O
best O
thing O
i O
tasted O
were O
the O
lambchops B
. O

it's O
delicious O
! O

the O
spicy B
tuna B
and O
salmon B
are O
the O
best O
we've O
ever O
had O
. O

even O
though O
its O
good O
seafood B
, O
the O
prices B
are O
too O
high O
. O

in O
addition O
, O
the O
food B
is O
very O
good O
and O
the O
prices B
are O
reasonable O
. O

upon O
entering O
, O
we O
were O
greeted O
by O
the O
owners B
, O
steven O
and O
frederick O
, O
who O
went O
out O
of O
their O
way O
to O
be O
more O
than O
gracious O
hosts B
. O

if O
you O
live O
outside O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
don't O
bother O
! O

been O
going O
here O
since O
it O
opened O
have O
seen O
the O
quality B
value B
decrease O
considerably O
. O

meat O
dishes B
now O
adorn O
the O
selections O
, O
although O
there's O
still O
a O
large O
number O
of O
vegetarian O
friendly O
choices B
. O

i O
never O
had O
anything O
i O
didn't O
like O
here O
. O

reasonable O
prices B
. O

they O
bring O
service B
up O
a O
notch O
by O
offerng O
complementary O
amuse B
bouche B
to O
all O
tables B
and O
gave O
us O
a O
small O
dessert B
for O
our O
celebration O
. O

try O
the O
crunchy B
tuna B
, O
it O
is O
to O
die O
for O
. O

it O
won't O
break O
the O
bank O
but O
i O
also O
wouldnt O
come O
back O
for O
the O
food B
. O

all O
in O
all O
, O
this O
midtown O
gem O
instantly O
became O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
sushi B
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
. O

i've O
been O
to O
joya O
twice O
and O
i O
will O
never O
go O
again O
. O

so O
rushing O
us O
out O
was O
absolutely O
unnecessary O
! O

however O
it O
is O
the O
only O
taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

it O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
with O
live B
entertainment B
and O
all O
kinds O
of O
disney O
type O
special B
effects B
. O

if O
you're O
looking O
for O
perfect O
traditional O
sushi B
, O
go O
here O
if O
you're O
looking O
for O
interesting O
combinations O
, O
try O
sushi B
of O
gari's O
east O
side O
. O

no O
refills O
on O
fountain B
drinks B
, O
though O
. O

wow O
over O
<number> O
beers B
to O
choose O
from O
. O

be O
careful O
of O
portions B
they're O
huge O
. O

the O
steak O
tartare O
is O
a O
great O
bet O
, O
they O
fix O
it O
for O
you O
at O
the O
table O
. O

my O
first O
time O
there O
i O
happened O
not O
to O
like O
the O
crab O
croquette O
apt B
that O
i O
ordered O
and O
they O
were O
happy O
to O
change O
it O
for O
me O
without O
making O
no O
big O
deal O
. O

great O
for O
large O
groups O
and O
celebrations O
our O
super O
happy O
waiter B
was O
the O
entertainment O
of O
the O
evening O
. O

did O
i O
mention O
the O
wine B
? O

plus O
, O
on O
wednesday O
nights O
the O
house B
wine B
is O
unlimited O
! O

it O
is O
by O
far O
my O
favorite O
restaurant O
in O
brooklyn O
. O

now O
it's O
so O
crowded O
and O
loud O
you O
can't O
even O
talk O
to O
the O
person O
next O
to O
you O
. O

love O
pizza O
<number> O
. O
. O

even O
my O
indian O
friend O
couldn't O
believe O
how O
good O
and O
tasty O
everything O
was O
. O

i'm O
from O
england O
, O
and O
haru's O
was O
the O
best O
i O
had O
in O
nyc O
. O

less O
more O
in O
their O
case O
. O

ruby O
foo's O
is O
a O
tourist O
trap O
. O

i've O
been O
here O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
and O
have O
not O
been O
impressed O
. O

i've O
been O
many O
time O
and O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

ciao O
bella O

like O
saying O
her O
bread B
comes O
from O
a O
special O
bakery O
when O
we O
have O
seen O
her O
buying O
it O
dowtown O
manhathan O
. O

the O
dim B
sum B
servings B
here O
are O
a O
bit O
larger O
than O
i'm O
used O
to O
. O

however O
, O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
<number> O
, O
it O
seems O
the O
management B
has O
changed O
and O
the O
great O
big O
door B
has O
been O
replaced O
for O
a O
glass B
front B
ridding O
itself O
of O
the O
dark O
romantic O
getup O
. O

we O
won't O
go O
to O
this O
place O
again O
for O
a O
good O
meal B
. O

it's O
a O
much O
more O
grown O
up O
restaurant O
compared O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
street O
. O

barbecued O
codfish B
was O
gorgeously O
moist O
as O
if O
poached O
yet O
the O
fabulous O
texture B
was O
let O
down O
by O
curiously O
bland O
seasoning B
a O
spice B
rub B
might O
have O
overwhelmed O
, O
however O
herb B
mix B
or O
other O
sauce B
would O
have O
done O
much O
to O
enhance O
. O

we O
were O
treated O
with O
attitude O
ever O
since O
the O
moment O
we O
stepped O
into O
the O
restaurant O
! O

after O
dinner B
, O
take O
your O
date O
to O
the O
huge O
dance B
floor B
, O
probably O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
you'll O
see O
in O
ny O
. O

taj O
mahal O
offeres O
gret O
value B
and O
great O
food B
. O

has O
the O
chef B
and O
owner B
changed O
? O
? O
? O

my O
boyfriend O
and O
i O
recently O
had O
an O
early O
dinner B
at O
artisanal O
and O
was O
satisfied O
with O
our O
experience O
. O

i O
absolutely O
loved O
this O
place O
. O

i O
wish O
i O
lived O
there O
as O
i O
would O
eat O
at O
this O
place O
as O
often O
as O
possible O
! O

but O
don't O
ever O
order O
bacon B
late O
at O
nite O
either O

or O
in B
sandwiches B
, O
for O
that O
matter O

almost O
like O
bacos B
, O

my O
molars O
. O

outstanding O

but O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

pizza B
the O
only O
pizza B
in O
nyc O
that O
should O
not O
have O
additional O
toppings B
the O
crust B
tastes O
like O
the O
best O
, O
freshly O
baked O
bread B
! O

if O
you're O
in O
town O
, O
it's O
worth O
searching O
for O
another O
place O
. O

i O
have O
tried O
the O
various O
slice O
joints O
around O
the O
village O
but O
this O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
one O
. O

i O
found O
it O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
, O
the O
perfect O
spot B
to O
warm O
up O
. O

they O
even O
have O
a O
section O
in O
the O
menu B
called O
american O
chinese O
food B
! O

service O
was O
warm O
and O
attentive O
, O
beef B
carpaachio B
was O
exellent O
huge O
portion B
and O
pasta B
was O
fresh O
and O
well O
prepared O
. O

kalbi B
and O
nebbiolo B
do O
work O
together O
. O

best O
italian O

to O
all O
of O
my O
friends O
for O
a O
place O
to O
go O
for O
wonderful O
italian O
food B
. O

located O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
magnificent O
block O
. O

this O
restaurant O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
time O
, O
effort O
, O
or O
money O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

looking O
around O
, O
i O
saw O
a O
room B
full O
of O
new O
yorkers O
enjoying O
a O
real O
meal B
in O
a O
real O
restaurant O
, O
not O
a O
clubhouse B
of O

, O
most O
gorgeous O
bartenders B
you've O
ever O
seen O
specifically O
the O
blond O
lady O
. O

we O
were O
planning O
to O
get O
dessert B
but O
the O
waitress B
basically O
through O
the O
bill B
at O
us O
before O
we O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
order O
. O

really O
. O

i O
really O
loved O
the O
different O
and O
inovated O
touch O
that's O
the O
cheff B
gives O
to O
the O
food B
. O

our O
friends O
have O
not O
arrived O
yet O
. O

they O
came O
out O
over O
cooked O
and O
the O
cheese B
was O
almost O
non O
existant O
. O

i O
had O
a O
terrific O
meal B
, O
and O
our O
server B
guided O
us O
toward O
a O
very O
nice O
wine B
in O
our O
price B
range B
, O
instead O
of O
allowing O
us O
to O
purchase O
a O
similarly O
priced B
wine B
that O
wasn't O
as O
good O
. O

the O
svc B
can O
be O
a O
bit O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
esp O
if O
you O
have O
big O
group O
, O
but O
overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
a O
must O
! O

my O
husband O
and O
i O
thougt O
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
go O
to O
the O
jekyll O
and O
hyde O
pub O
for O
our O
anniversary O
, O
and O
to O
our O
surprise O
it O
was O
fantastic O
. O

never O
once O
did O
i O
leave O
feeling O
unwelcome O
or O
impressed O
. O

the O
food B
is O
good O
, O
especially O
their O
more O
basic O
dishes B
, O
and O
the O
drinks B
are O
delicious O
. O

but O
the O
main O
hit O
was O
the O
whole B
grilled B
fish B
. O

i O
had O
the O
tuna B
tartare B
with O
sake B
, O
mushroom B
ravioli B
with O
pinot B
noir B
, O
and O
the O
chocolate B
sampler B
with O
a O
dessert B
wine B
for O
<number> O
. O

on O
a O
hot O
day O
it O
was O
fabulous O
to O
stop O
in O
and O
enjoy O
lunch B
. O

the O
food B
is O
delicious O
and O
beautifully O
prepared O
along O
with O
the O
friendly O
and O
personable O
service B
. O

i O
usually O
go O
there O
later O
at O
night O
when O
i O
get O
off O
work O
so O
i O
don't O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
crowds B
or O
lines B
. O

pizza O
here O
is O
consistently O
good O
. O

we O
had O
a O
great O
tiem O
watching O
the O
shows B
and O
characters B
and O
ar O
food B
was O
just O
what O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
. O

after O
<number> O
tries O
by O
the O
waiter B
to O
take O
it O
away O
we O
hadn't O
even O
looked O
at O
it O
yet O
, O
we O
had O
full O
beers B
yet O
to O
drink O
, O
the O
manager B
approached O
and O
told O
us O
they O
needed O
the O
table O
for O
people O
with O
reservations B
. O

wouldn't O
recomend O
it O
for O
dinner B
! O

sauce O
was O
watery O
and O
the O
food B
didn't O
have O
much O
flavor B
. O

my O
husband O
and O
i O
enjoy O
sangria O
. O

but O
after O
last O
night O
, O
spice O
grill O
is O
the O
only O
place O
i'm O
eating O
indian B
cuisine B
. O

we O
both O
opted O
for O
a O
pasta B
dish B
and O
they O
were O
served B
timely O
and O
fresh O
. O

first O
the O
wrong O
bread B
came O
out O
with O
the O
appetizer B
, O
then O
when O
i O
tried O
to O
order O
a O
second O
glass B
of B
wine B
for O
my O
main B
course B
. O
. O
. O

not O
sure O
where O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
, O
lonk O
, O
dined O
, O
but O
saul O
is O
in O
a O
great O
neighborhood B
and O
has O
great O
food B
! O

in O
an O
area O
sadly O
lacking O
in O
decent O
thai O
food B
, O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
spots O
. O

tell O
them O
herky O
sent O
you O
and O
get O
a O
free O
confused O
look O
from O
the O
waiter B
. O

make O
reservations B
but O
expect O
to O
be O
delayed O
<number> O
<number> O
minutes O
as O
the O
hosting B
staff B
was O
having O
difficulty O
seating B
guests O
who O
arrived O
with O
a O
reservation B
because O
they O
probably O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
walk O
ins O
being O
so O
close O
to O
time O
square O
. O

the O
food B
was O
average O
or O
above O
including O
some O
surprising O
tasty O
dishes B
. O

they O
don't O
seem O
to O
place O
an O
emphasis O
on O
specials B
or O
fresh O
ingredients B
which O
to O
me O
is O
necessary O
for O
good O
thai B
. O

other O
apetizers B
and O
food B

the O
noodle B
and B
rices B
dishes B
taste O
great O
. O

the O
food's O
as O
good O
as O
ever O
. O

the O
crust B
is O
thin O
, O
the O
ingredients B
are O
fresh O
and O
the O
staff B
is O
friendly O
. O

your O
friends O
will O
thank O
you O
for O
introducing O
them O
to O
this O
gem O
! O

also O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
your O
average O
bagel B
place O
. O

the O
food B
was O
undercooked O
the O
sauce B
watery O
, O
and O
the O
vegetables B
raw O
. O

and O
the O
fried B
clams B
had O
just O
enough O
kick O
to O
them O
to O
make O
'em O
worth O
eating O
. O

the O
sauces B
used O
are O
also O
not O
that O
exciting O
. O

the O
secret O
is O
the O
lunch B
menu B
which O
offers O
a O
complimentary O
appetizer B
with O
every O
entree B
ordered O
. O

i O
absolutely O
love O
this O
place O
! O
! O
! O

the O
rice B
was O
poor O
quality B
and O
was O
cooked B
so O
badly O
it O
was O
hard O
. O

we O
had O
champagne B
and O
caviar B
and O
felt O
like O
princesses O
! O

the O
shrimp B
scampi B
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
antipasti B
were O
plentiful O
. O

i O
am O
surprised O
to O
say O
the O
least O
and O
find O
such O
practice O
not O
worth O
the O
effort O
. O

when O
my O
dessert B
came O
, O
there O
was O
a O
candle O
in O
it O
not O
because O
anyone O
asked O
for O
one O
but O
because O
the O
waiter B
must O
have O
seen O
me O
opening O
my O
birthday O
card O
and O
gift O
, O
and O
said O
he O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
special O
occassion O
of O
some O
sort O
. O

i O
got O
the O
<number> O
<number> O
piece O
dim B
sum B
combo B
, O
every O
bite O
of O
which O
was O
great O
. O

there O
are O
other O
vietnamese O
restaurants O
in O
the O
chinatown O
area O
and O
you O
can O
forget O
about O
those O
. O

there O
is O
also O
very O
limited O
seating B
and O
there O
can O
be O
a O
substantial O
wait B
in O
getting O
food B
at O
peak O
times O
. O

if O
it's O
just O
a O
quick O
martini B
at O
the O
bar B
which O
i O
recommend O
jeffery's O
or O
a O
mind O
blowing O
roast O
chicken O
, O
go O
to O
village O
! O

no O
thanks O
! O
! O
! O

there O
was O
a O
long O
wait B
for O
a O
table B
outside O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
little O
too O
hot O
in O
the O
sun O
anyway O
so O
our O
insde B
table B
was O
very O
nice O
. O

i O
would O
definently O
recommend O
this O
restaurant O
. O

the O
prices B
are O
wonderfully O
low O
. O

if O
you O
like O
spicy B
food B
get O
the O
chicken B
vindaloo B
. O

i O
love O
this O
place O
! O

i O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
but O
their O
true O
strength O
lays O
in O
their O
amazingly O
delicious O
and O
cheap O
lunch B
specials B
. O

so O
much O
more O
than O
the O
usual O
bar B
food B
, O
go O
there O
to O
enjoy O
the O
menu B
while O
sampling O
one O
of O
their O
hand O
crafted O
beers B
. O

a O
big O
disappointment O
, O
all O
around O
. O

and O
its O
absolutely O
delicious O
. O

no O
free O
drink B
. O

i O
would O
say O
that O
all O
was O
fine O
and O
tasty O
but O
the O
heaviness O
on O
my O
stomach O
someting O
that O
i O
can't O
not O
mention O
or O
undermine O
. O

this O
is O
my O
first O
time O
writing O
a O
review O
for O
a O
restaurant O
because O
the O
food B
and O
service B
was O
excellent O
. O

definitely O
highly O
not O
recommended O
. O

while O
they O
keep O
the O
capex B
to O
a O
minimum O
, O
they O
do O
put O
some O
cash O
into O
the O
bagels B
, O
because O
they O
among O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city O
. O

i O
had O
a O
huge O
group O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
were O
well O
taken O
care O
of O
. O

the O
two O
star O
chefs B
left O
quite O
some O
time O
ago O
to O
open O
their O
own O
place O
. O

don't O
waste O
money O
on O
decor B
. O

they O
also O
have O
a O
back B
garden B
open O
in O
the O
summer O
cute O
and O
french O
with O
outdoor B
seating B
what O
more O
could O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

go O
to O
any O
corned O
indian O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
little O
india O
strip O
along O
east O
<number> O
st O
rules O
supreme O
! O

i O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
<number> O
pieces O
of O
relatively O
good O
nigiri B
. O

given O
the O
incredible O
architecture B
surrounding O
it O
, O
this O
place B
has O
no O
character O
. O

i'd O
call O
it O
an O
'italian O
dinner' O
. O

my O
first O
time O
here O
was O
with O
my O
gf O
for O
our O
<number> O
month O
anniversary O
. O

while O
the O
place B
is O
not O
a O
hotspot O
hangout O
, O
the O
drinks B
are O
unique O
and O
pack O
a O
lot O
of O
bang O
for O
the O
buck O
. O

i O
have O
walked O
by O
this O
place O
for O
eons O
and O
finally O
went O
thanks O
to O
a O
girls' O
night O
. O

have O
frequented O
'ino O
for O
several O
years O
and O
the O
food B
remains O
excellent O
. O

their O
eggplant B
is O
so O
delicate O
, O
sweet O
tender O
! O

i O
pray O
it O
stays O
open O
forever O
. O

each O
bite O
of O
food B
at O
kai O
was O
indeed O
delicious O
, O
fresh O
, O
and O
elegant O
. O

all O
the O
food B
was O
excellent O
considering O
the O
quality B
of B
food B
in O
most O
moderately O
priced B
restaurants O
is O
mediocre O
this O
was O
slightly O
more O
pricey O
and O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

if O
you O
want O
to O
save O
some O
money O
, O
don't O
go O
here O
. O

my O
friend O
got O
the O
mushroom B
pizza B
which O
tasted O
better O
. O

i O
had O
the O
cod B
with B
paella B
spicy O
and B
very O
filling O
, O
i'm O
a O
big O
eater O
and B
could O
only O
eat O
half O
while O
my O
boyfriend O
had O
the O
classic O
fish B
and B
chips B
again O
, O
a O
big O
serving B
at O
least O
<number> O
pieces O
of O
fish B
and B
a O
basketful O
of O
fries B
. O

it's O
a O
shame O
that O
a O
nice O
, O
convenient O
place B
like O
the O
pink O
pony O
can O
be O
so O
ruined O
by O
lousy O
service B
. O

this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
citysearch O
did't O
call O
it O
right O
. O

you O
should O
pass O
on O
the O
calamari B
. O

the O
porcini B
mushroom B
pasta B
special B
was O
tasteless O
, O
so O
was O
the O
seafood B
tagliatelle B
. O

try O
the O
spicy B
wontons B
and O
the O
salt B
pepper B
shrimps B
. O

the O
food O
portions O
are O
really O
large O
. O

the O
fries B
are O
yummy O
. O

friendly O
and O
informative O
staff B
, O
very O
attentive O
and O
prompt O
raw O
bar B
service B

best O

i O
have O
eaten O
at O
many O
pizza O
places O
around O
nyc O
and O
this O
is O
hands O
down O
the O
worst O
. O

this O
place O
is O
a O
great O
stop O
for O
great O
food B
. O

all O
the O
pastas B
are O
fantastic O
and O
the O
homemade B
lasagna B
is O
some O
of O
the O
best O
that O
i O
have O
had O
in O
the O
city O
. O

what O
for O
? O

fantastic O
! O

they O
were O
dry O
and O
disgusting O
, O
i O
didn't O
even O
finish O
my O
first O
piece O
. O

highly O
recommended O
for O
a O
first O
date O
. O

we O
laughed O
when O
he O
finally O
offered O
us O
a O
dessert B
menu B
and O
we O
left O
a O
<number> O
percent O
tip B
, O
which O
was O
generous O
, O
i O
feel O
. O

and O
the O
prices B
were O
way O
to O
high O
for O
what O
you O
get O
. O

but O
people O
from O
sichuan O
will O
die O
for O
it O
chongqing O
hot O
pot O
, O
chongqing O
was O
the O
biggest O
city O
of O
sichuan O
, O
now O
became O

ignored O
my O
friends O

i O
the O
entire O
time O
we O
were O
there O
. O

yet O
paired O
with O
such O
rude O
service B

never O
recommend O

anyone O
interested O
in O

any O
kind O
of O

a O
huge O
disappointment O

all O

all O
it O
didn't O
break O

the O

the O
beauty O
of O
authentic O

i O
recieved O

returned O
the O
week O
before O
christmas O
and O
was O
hugely O
disappointed O
. O

went O
here O
on O
a O
friend's O
reccomendation O
. O

not O
the O
food B
, O
not O
the O
ambiance B
, O
not O
the O
service B
, O
i O
agree O
with O
the O
previous O
reviews O
you O
wait B
and O
wait B
, O
the O
wait B
staff B
are O
very O
rude O
and O
when O
you O
get O
in O
they O
are O
looking O
to O
get O
you O
right O
out O
. O

i O
love O
ess O
a O
bagel O
, O
but O
i O
live O
on O
the O
west O
side O
, O
so O
i O
often O
go O
to O
murray's O
for O
convenience O
. O

i O
always O
get O
the O
shabu O
shabu O
dinner B
and O
the O
beef B
is O
always O
fresh O
. O

the O
pizza B
was O
delivered O
cold O
and O
the O
cheese B
wasn't O
even O
fully O
melted O
! O

we O
were O
very O
surprised O
by O
how O
good O
the O
food B
was O
on O
our O
first O
visit O
here O
on O
a O
sunday O
night O
. O

nha O
trang O
, O
while O
being O
notorious O
for O
utter O
lack O
of O
comfort B
and O
decor B
, O
horribly O
slow O
wait B
staff B
and O
horribly O
quick O
meals B
, O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
vietnamese O
restaurants O
i've O
ever O
been O
to O
. O
the O
pho B
is O
delicious O
and O
comes O
with O
very O
fresh O
vegtables B
. O

on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
if O
you O
are O
not O
fooled O
easily O
, O
you O
will O
find O
hundreds O
of O
restaurants O
that O
will O
give O
you O
service B
and O
ambiance B
that O
is O
on O
par O
with O
alain O
ducasse O
, O
and O
food B
that O
will O
outshine O
in O
presentaion B
, O
taste B
, O
choice B
, O
quality B
and O
quantity B
. O

we O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
. O

i O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
my O
friends O
meet O
me O
down O
here O
not O
only O
for O
the O
bar B
scene B
but O
also O
the O
promise O
of O
the O
pizza O
place O
at O
3am O
. O

is O
just O
the O
way O
it O
was O
in O
days O
gone O
by O
. O

if O
i O
could O
rate O
the O
people B
this O
place O
would O
be O
off O
the O
charts O
unfortunately O
the O
pizza B
, O
sorry O
not O
the O
best O
in O
nyc O
. O

the O
food B
is O
amazing O
! O
! O
! O
! O

having O
not O
been O
home O
in O
the O
last O
<number> O
years O
may O
skew O
this O
reviewer O
a O
bit O
, O
but O
the O
food B
was O
tasty O
and O
spicy O
sans O
the O
oil B
that O
comes O
floating O
along O
at O
similar O
venues O
. O

the O
portions B
are O
now O
very O
small O
, O
the O
sauces B
are O
overly O
ambitious O
usually O
inedible O
while O
the O
service B
is O
still O
good O
, O
the O
restaurant O
, O
due O
to O
its O
popularity O
, O
seems O
frantic O
. O

for O
the O
price B
, O
you O
cannot O
eat O
this O
well O
in O
manhattan O
. O

the O
owner B
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
a O
great O
guy O
, O
go O
try O
his O
pizza B
, O
you'll O
like O
it O
! O

the O
atmosphere B
is O
great O
! O
! O
! O

it O
can O
be O
a O
very O
fun O
experience O
with O
a O
group O
, O
and O
kids O
<number> O
and O
over O
would O
love O
it O
. O

with O
so O
many O
good O
restaurants O
on O
the O
uws O
, O
i O
don't O
need O
overpriced O
food B
, O
absurdly O
arrogant O
wait O
staff O
who O
don't O
recognize O
they O
work O
at O
a O
glorified O
diner B
, O
clumsy O
service B
, O
and O
management B
that O
doesn't O
care O
. O

i O
tend O
to O
judge O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
by O
its O
sea B
urchin B
, O
which O
was O
heavenly O
at O
sushi O
rose O
. O

the O
service B
is O
a O
little O
scatty O
at O
times O
but O
all O
is O
forgiven O
when O
the O
food B
arrives O
. O

the O
bruscetta B
is O
a O
bit O
soggy O
, O
but O
the O
salads B
were O
fresh O
, O
included O
a O
nice O
mix B
of B
greens B
not O
iceberg B
all O
dishes B
are O
served B
piping O
hot O
from O
the O
kitchen O
. O

and O
evaluated O
on O
those O
terms O
pastis O
is O
simply O
wonderful O
. O

the O
atmosphere B
isn't O
the O
greatest O
, O
but O
i O
suppose O
that's O
how O
they O
keep O
the O
prices B
down O
. O

the O
pickles B
were O
great O
addition O
. O

if O
your O
favorite O
chinese O
food B
is O
general O
tao O
chicken B
, O
then O
this O
is O
not O
your O
place O
. O

you O
must O
try O
the O
shrimp B
appetizers B
. O

not O
only O
is O
the O
cuisine B
the O
best O
around O
, O
the O
service B
has O
always O
been O
attentive O
and O
charming O
. O

filled O
with O
suits O
, O
though O
, O
so O
you O
never O
really O
feel O
terribly O
comfortable O
. O

the O
production O
is O
a O
symphony O
, O
alot O
of O
fun O
to O
experience O
. O
the O
food B
sublime O
for O
the O
most O
part O
. O

waiters O
tend O
to O
forget O
drinks B
completely O
, O
food B
portions B
are O
so O
tiny O
, O
two O
people O
have O
trouble O
sharing O
one O
entree B
. O

my O
wife O
and O
i O
have O
been O
going O
to O
nyc O
for O
years O
and O
wouldn't O
miss O
roxy O
, O
s O
food B
is O
expensive O
but O
it's O
new O
york O
! O

it's O
like O
you O
are O
transported O
to O
the O
italian O
countryside O
, O
very O
romantic O
and O
filled O
with O
antiques O
. O

the O
cold B
appetizer B
dishes B
taste O
like O
the O
way O
i O
remember O
them O
to O
taste O
when O
i O
was O
growing O
up O
in O
taiwan O
. O

just O
go O
and O
see O
for O
yourself O
. O

the O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
at O
first O
, O
so O
we O
waited O
at O
the O
bar B
for O
about O
<number> O
minutes O
before O
we O
were O
seated O
. O

interesting O
selection O
, O
good O
wines B
, O
service B
fine O
, O
fun O
decor B
. O

i O
hate O
this O
. O

any O
if O
you O
have O
a O
reservation B
you'll O
wait O
for O
max O
<number> O
minutes O
so O
have O
a O
drink B
at O
the O
bar B
. O

whether O
it's O
the O
parmesean B
porcini B
souffle B
or O
the O
lamb B
glazed B
with B
balsamic B
vinegar B
, O
you O
will O
surely O
be O
transported O
to O
northern O
italy O
with B
one O
bite O
. O

that O
place O
was O
awesome O
, O
, O
, O
sally O
! O

the O
food B
at O
this O
place O
is O
'gourmet' B
indian O
cuisine B
. O

finally O
a O
reliable O
chinese O
restaurant O
! O

get O
over O
it O
! O

but O
the O
thing O
that O
my O
wife O
and O
i O
hated O
was O
it O
was O
so O
loud O
and O
it O
felt O
like O
'bar' O
or O
'pub' O
. O

however O
, O
it O
just O
so O
happens O
that O
there's O
an O
even O
more O
amazing O
place O
just O
down O
the O
street O
. O

while O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
places O
to O
go O
for O
a O
good O
corned B
beef B
sandwich B
, O
katz's O
has O
a O
charm O
about O
it O
. O

however O
, O
looking O
at O
the O
table O
next O
to O
ours O
, O
we O
both O
sort O
of O
wished O
we O
had O
ordered O
pizza B
, O
which O
looked O
perrrrrrrrrfect O
. O

priced O
at O
upper O
intermediate O
range O
. O

the O
fish B
was O
adequate O
, O
but O
inexpertly O
sliced O
. O

i O
recommend O
ordering O
in O
on O
a O
weeknight O
. O

if O
you O
live O
in O
new O
york O
city O
, O
you'll O
find O
better O
food B
at O
small O
restaurants O
outside O
of O
time O
square O
and O
spend O
half O
the O
amount B
. O

try O
the O
olive B
cream B
cheese B
or O
the O
lox B
spread B
on O
a O
whole O
wheat O
everything O
bagel B
. O

while O
it's O
not O
nobu O
, O
it O
sure O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
and O
you O
definitely O
will O
leave O
feeling O
satisfied O
and O
full O
. O

so O
my O
husband O
made O
up O
an O
excuse O
so O
we O
can O
leave O
. O

it's O
very O
spicy O
but O
not O
offensive O
. O

they O
didn't O
disappoint O
, O
service B
from O
the O
second O
i O
arrived O
at O
the O
door O
was O
extremely O
pleasant O
and O
attentive O
with O
almost O
one O
server B
per O
table B
. O

i O
don't O
know O
who O
they O
think O
they O
are O
but O
they O
have O
no O
respect O
for O
the O
residents O
of O
the O
neighborhood O
ever O
since O
they O
opened O
their O
cabaret O
next O
door O
and O
blasts O
loud O
music B
till O
three O
in O
the O
morning O
every O
weekend O
during O
the O
summer O
. O

the O
rice B
to B
fish B
ration B
was O
also O
good O
they O
didn't O
try O
to B
overpack O
the O
rice B
. O

they O
used O
shredded B
cheese B
on O
top O
! O

they O
are O
located O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
chinatown O
! O

the O
food B
is O
great O
and O
they O
have O
a O
good O
selecion B
of B
wines B
at O
reasonable O
prices B
. O

eating O
at O
ottimo O
is O
like O
eating O
in O
chef O
salvatore O
esposito's O
home O
. O

katz's O
deli O
is O
a O
great O
ny O
experience O
. O

check O
it O
out O
. O

the O
only O
positive O
was O
the O
wait B
staff B
, O
which O
was O
prompt O
, O
knowledgable O
, O
and O
likeable O
. O

i O
couldn't O
reccommend O
their O
godmother O
pizza B
any O
higher O
. O

i O
am O
not O
a O
vegetarian O
but O
, O
almost O
all O
the O
dishes B
were O
great O
. O

i O
was O
very O
impressed O
by O
this O
low O
key O
upper O
eastsider O
and O
their O
authentically O
thai B
cuisine B
! O
! O
! O

i O
would O
go O
again O
if O
i O
didn't O
have O
to O
pay O
. O

for O
the O
location B
, O
the O
prices B
are O
very O
reasonable O
. O

the O
food B
is O
okay O
and O
the O
prices B
here O
are O
mediocre O
. O

my O
friend's O
food B
was O
also O
the O
complete O
opposite O
of O
what O
it's O
supposed O
to O
taste O
like O
and O
look O
like O
. O

i O
ordered O
the O
crab B
cocktail B
and O
it O
was O
soaked O
in O
a O
lime B
juice B
concoction B
where O
all O
you O
could O
taste O
was O
the O
lime B
. O

i O
would O
like O
to O
return O
and O
try O
some O
of O
the O
other O
menu B
items B
when O
i O
don't O
have O
to O
rush O
off O
to O
a O
show O
. O

we O
have O
been O
to O
this O
place O
many O
times O
, O
and O
always O
have O
great O
food B
, O
wine B
, O
and O
service B
. O

hopefully O
next O
time O
, O
i O
will O
save O
room O
for O
dessert B
. O

alain O
ducasse O
is O
the O
best O
of O
everything O
, O
i O
mean O
everything O
was O
excelent O
. O
i O

not O
a O
typical O
pizza O
joint O
, O
but O
good O
for O
a O
low O
key O
and O
fairly O
cheap O
nice O
sit O
down O
dinner B
. O

the O
corned B
beef B
was O
tender O
and O
melted O
in O
my O
mouth O
. O

go O
here O
. O

the O
best O
chicken O
pad B
tai B
, O
i've O
ever O
had O
. O

we O
weren't O
even O
at O
our O
table O
for O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
total O
. O

<number> O
for O
all O
you O
can O
eat O
sushi B
cannot O
be O
beaten O
. O

it O
has O
been O
my O
first O
choice O
ever O
since O
i O
discovered O
it O
. O

over O
<number> O
different O
choices O
to O
create O
your O
own O
. O

haru O
serves O
very O
fresh O
fish B
, O
has O
a O
trendy O
, O
modern O
ambiance B
, O
prime O
location B
on O
park O
avenue O
south O
and O
friendly O
service B
. O

warm O
and O
friendly O
in O
the O
winter O
and O
terrific O
outdoor B
seating B
in O
the O
warmer O
months O
. O

very O
romantic O
fires O
i've O
literally O
spent O
hours O
at O
lanterna O
, O
drinking O
wine B
from O
their O
extensive O
wine B
and O
enjoying O
the O
ambience B
. O

we O
got O
a O
little O
tipsy O
from O
the O
sake B
but O
isn't O
that O
what O
saturday O
nights O
with O
the O
girlfriends O
are O
all O
about O
? O

i O
almost O
wanted O
to O
write O
a O
bad O
review O
, O
so O
no O
one O
would O
ever O
go O
here O
and O
i O
could O
have O
all O
the O
dumplings B
to O
myself O
! O

after O
reading O
the O
posts O
, O
i O
was O
always O
skeptical O
to O
go O
to O
the O
minnow O
, O
despite O
living O
in O
park O
slope O
. O

i O
loved O
it O
and O
will O
be O
back O
soon O
. O

always O
a O
nice O
crowd B
, O
but O
never O
loud O
. O

my O
turkey B
burger B
was O
not O
cooked O
at O
all O
, O
my O
friends O
salmon B
was O
completely O
raw O
. O

the O
service B
is O
spotty O
, O
sometimes O
really O
friendly O
and O
sometimes O
barely O
there O
. O

decor O
is O
minimalist O
and O
clean O
nothing O
to O
distract O
or O
commend O
. O

his O
drinks B
are O
very O
inventive O
, O
delicious O
and O
classy O
. O

great O
food B
, O
great O
prices B
, O
great O
service B
. O

this O
isn't O
your O
corner O
chinese O
food B
takeout O
. O

awsome O
pizza O
especially O
the O
margheritta O
slice O
. O

this O
place B
, O
however O
, O
has O
a O
lot O
less O
pretension O
than O
joya O
and O
the O
thai O
food B
is O
still O
above O
average O
. O

my O
husband O
and O
i O
ate O
here O
after O
reading O
reviews O
here O
as O
well O
as O
hobokeni O
. O
com O
, O

try O
ordering O
from O
the O
regular O
menu B
, O
then O
you O
would O
not O
regret O
! O

told O
us O
to O
sit O
anywhere O
, O
and O
when O
we O
sat O
he O
said O
the O
table B
was O
reserved O
. O

uni O
from O
maine O
vs O
california O
, O
sea O
vs O
freshwater O
eel B
to O
get O
a O
good O
taste O
comparison O
. O

we O
started O
with O
lox B
and O
mussels B
the O
best O
ive O
ever O
had O
, O
ever O
and O
had O
the O
cod B
and O
trout B
for O
dinner B
. O

the O
crispy B
chicken B
wasn't O
for O
us O
, O
though O
. O

just O
awsome O
. O

food O
is O
great O
. O

there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
variety O
even O
for O
people O
who O
eat O
vegetarian O
like O
me O
. O

i O
recommend O
the O
meatballs B
and O
caprese B
salad B
and O
the O
beans B
on B
toast B
were O
a O
wonderful O
start O
to O
the O
meal B
! O

this O
place B
is O
incredibly O
tiny O
. O

i O
will O
definetely O
go O
back O
again O
and O
again O
, O
that's O
for O
sure O
! O
! O
! O

i O
didn't O
complain O
, O
i O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B
so O
much O
. O

this O
is O
one O
of O
our O
all O
time O
favorite O
. O

in O
reality O
to O
maximize O
potential O
diners B
they O
were O
still O
taking O
phone O
reservations B
and O
reallocating O
tables B
of O
those O
waiting B
in O
the O
lobby B
. O

the O
wine B
is O
always O
good O
, O
the O
tapas B
are O
always O
yummy O
, O
especially O
with O
the O
warm O
pita B
bread B
. O

but O
when O
you O
are O
seated O
the O
waitresses B
are O
great O
, O
they O
explain O
everything O
on O
the O
menu B
, O
and O
the O
price B
of O
the O
food B
is O
really O
cheap O
for O
the O
service B
you O
get O
. O

this O
place O
is O
amazingly O
bad O
. O

compared O
to O
other O
shabu O
restaurants O
around O
town O
, O
this O
places O
wins O
hands O
down O
. O

i've O
been O
to O
several O
places O
for O
dim O
sum O
and O
this O
has O
got O
to O
be O
the O
worst O
. O

i O
love O
this O
place O
. O

the O
freshest O
, O
best O
variety B
, O
and O
the O
fastest O
delivery B
. O

go O
to O
volare O
for O
1st O
class O
service B
and O
terrific O
food B
. O

it's O
super O
trendy O
and O
there's O
always O
someone O
to O
take O
that O
empty O
seat B
, O
so O
it O
seems O
that O
customer O
service B
has O
been O
deemed O
not O
of O
the O
essence O
. O

dinner O
took O
almost O
<number> O
hours O
without O
any O
lag O
time O
. O

the O
people B
in O
the O
restaurant O
were O
pretty O
obnoxious O
and O
loud O
. O

the O
sandwiches B
are O
dry O
, O
tasteless O
and O
way O
overpriced O
. O

the O
problem O
is O
just O
that O
it O
is O
a O
sometimes O
kind O
of O
affair O
. O

price O
no O
more O
than O
a O
jersey O
deli O
but O
way O
better O
. O

the O
fried B
rice B
is O
really O
good O
too O
. O

we O
were O
well O
attended O
to O
by O
the O
enthusiastic O
staff B
especially O
the O
manager B
tony O
gaskin O
who O
made O
excellent O
suggestions O
for O
our O
menu B
selections B
. O

made O
my O
dining B
experience B
uncomfortable O
. O

it's O
a O
steal O
! O

we O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
based O
on O
prior O
internet O
comments O
. O

still O
stay O
away O
, O
the O
table O
next O
to O
us O
walked O
out O
after O
my O
table O
and O
aanother O
were O
serves B
eventhough O
they O
were O
there O
much O
longer O
. O
. O
. O

i O
was O
with O
a O
party O
of O
<number> O
close O
but O
not O
next O
the O
the O
front B
doors B
and O
we O
were O
eating O
with O
our O
coats O
on O
. O

a O
very O
inviting O
restaurant O
, O
with O
friendly O
service B
. O

the O
back B
garden B
sitting B
area B
is O
very O
pleasant O
, O
where O
you O
can O
see O
their O
personal B
herb B
garden B
. O

what's O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
two O
? O

will O
go O
back O
but O
only O
sate O
those O
homesick O
stomach O
cravings O
! O

good O
french O
restaurant O
in O
an O
area O
devoid O
of O
decent O
restaurants O
unless O
you're O
into O
eating O
<number> O
pound O
pastrami B
sandwiches B
at O
katz' O
deli O
, O
or O
mexican O
food B
which O
is O
supplied O
by O
capable O
restaurants O
. O

i O
was O
very O
disappointed O
with O
this O
restaurant O
. O

the O
drinks B
are O
always O
welll O
made O
and O
wine B
selection B
is O
fairly O
priced B
. O

we O
also O
had O
shared O
a O
house B
salad B
that O
was O
fresh O
. O

the O
ceiling B
is O
amazing O
! O

my O
wife O
and O
i O
were O
in O
nyc O
celebrating O
our O
30th O
anniversary O
. O

i'm O
glad O
i O
was O
introduced O
to O
this O
place O
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
ny O
. O

and O
at O
the O
conclusion O
of B
this O
culinary O
nightmare O
the O
check B
was O
given O
to O
our O
table B
by O
knocking O
over O
a O
glass B
of B
water B
. O

not O
a O
small O
feat O
for O
good O
french B
food B
in O
the O
area O
. O

the O
space B
is O
a O
bit O
too O
small O
for O
live B
music B
, O
so O
on O
jazz B
nights B
, O
it O
can O
be O
loud O
and O
cramped O
. O

food O
was O
average O
but O
tasty O
. O

we O
come O
from O
new O
jersey O
to O
eat O
at O
kinoko O
. O

big O
wong O
gets O
big O
ups O
for O
a O
fine O
establishment B
. O

will O
never O
be O
back O
. O

the O
entree B
was O
bland O
and O
small O
, O
dessert B
was O
not O
inspired O
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

oh O
and O
it's O
too O
tiny O
for O
families O
with O
strollers O
. O

the O
staff B
was O
the O
friendliest O
that O
have O
seen O
in O
new O
york O
. O

with O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon B
salad B
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper B
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
, O
the O
food B
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

the O
pad O
thai B
, O
lad B
nar B
and O
various O
other O
dishes B
all O
look O
good O
on O
paper O
but O
, O
i've O
had O
better O
thai B
food B
in O
less O
asthetically O
pleasing O
places B
. O

delicious O
food B
at O
a O
great O
price B
but O
do O
not O
go O
here O
on O
a O
cold O
day O
and O
sit O
by O
the O
front B
door B
. O

my O
picks O
guizhou O
chicken B
, O
fish B
with B
hot B
bean B
source B
, O
fish B
fillet B
in B
spicy B
source B
special B
menu B
. O

overall O
, O
i'm O
still O
impressed O
that O
the O
place O
even O
exists O
and O
the O
prices B
are O
quite O
decent O
but O
then O
again O
, O
its O
chinatown O
. O

admittedly O
some O
nights O
inside O
the O
restaurant O
were O
rather O
warm O
, O
but O
the O
open B
kitchen B
is O
part O
of O
the O
charm O
. O

my O
six O
year O
old O
loved O
it O
. O

pizza O
was O
a O
little O
soggy O
. O

the O
food B
inludes O
famous O
scrumptious O
bombay B
style B
chaat B
such O
as O
bhelpuri B
, O
sevpuri B
and O
samosa B
chaats B
, O
as O
well O
as O
other O
great O
indian B
appetizers B
. O

the O
singapore O
mai O
fun O
had O
no O
curry B
flavor B
whatsoever O
. O

the O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
manager B
is O
a O
complete O
incompetent O
. O

the O
wine B
list B
is O
interesting O
and O
has O
many O
good O
values O
. O

murray O
won't O
do O
it O
. O

i'm O
still O
mad O
that O
i O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
lousy O
food B
. O

this O
restaurant O
used O
to O
be O
our O
regular O
thursday O
night O
dinner B
location B
. O

definite O
go O
if O
you're O
used O
to O
good O
indian O
restaurant B
food B
from O
abroad O
. O

thr O
at O
moshphere O
is O
compact O
, O
modern O
, O
yet O
cozy O
. O

by O
far O
, O
the O
best O
pizza B
in O
manhattan O
. O

decent O
thai O
food B
in O
cute O
though O
a O
bit O
dank O
little O
nolita O
hangout O
, O
but O
service B
terrible O
. O

most O
people O
eat O
there O
seem O
to O
be O
typical O
upper O
east O
side O
snobs O
, O
so O
be O
aware O
. O

the O
waiter B
actually O
poured O
water B
on O
my O
hand O
and O
walked O
away O
. O

the O
food B
is O
mostly O
made O
from O
scratch O
, O
fresh O
and O
well O
prepared O
. O

worse O
of O
all O
, O
<number> O
was O
erroneously O
added O
to O
our O
<number> O
bill B
. O

too O
cold O
to O
enjoy O
. O

no O
more O
reservations B
, O
expensive O
tips B
and O
annoying O
stuff B
. O

try O
the O
sea B
bass B
. O

<number> O
gets O
you O
unlimited O
sushi B
of O
a O
very O
high O
quality B
i O
even O
took O
a O
friend O
here O
from O
japan O
who O
said O
it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
sushi B
places B
in O
the O
us O
that O
he O
has O
been O
to O
. O

i O
brought O
some O
buddies O
from O
ca O
and O
they O
loved O
it O
. O

inside O
is O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

sushi O
wasn't O
anything O
spectacular O
for O
the O
price B
. O

during O
our O
meal B
, O
the O
management B
came O
over O
and O
checked O
on O
us O
and O
even O
bought O
us O
a O
round B
of B
drinks B
. O

but O
they O
don't O
have O
a O
toaster B
, O
which O
is O
strange O
. O

so O
, O
for O
good O
food B
i'd O
recommend O
it O
, O
but O
not O
for O
a O
fun O
night O
out O
. O

the O
menu B
choices B
are O
similar O
but O
the O
taste B
lacked O
more O
flavor B
than O
it O
looked O
. O

a O
must O
for O
all O
the O
dosa O
lovers O
. O

the O
portions B
are O
huge O
, O
so O
it O
might O
be O
good O
to O
order O
three O
things O
to O
split O
rather O
than O
one O
appetizer B
and O
entree B
per O
person O
for O
two O
people O
. O

the O
appetizers B
are O
just O
ok O
and O
the O
main B
courses B
were O
decidedly O
subpar O
. O

someone O
else O
recommended O
the O
dessert B
we O
also O
left O
that O
. O

the O
exotic B
food B
is O
beautifully O
presented O
and O
is O
a O
delight O
in O
delicious O
combinations O
. O

the O
staff B
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
we O
can O
almost O
always O
get O
a O
table B
. O

if O
you O
are O
a O
vegetarian O
, O
this O
really O
isn't O
a O
good O
place O
to O
go O
. O

try O
the O
mediterranean B
salad B
, O
it O
is O
a O
true O
experience O
for O
your O
taste O
buds O
! O
! O

i'm O
sure O
i'll O
return O
for O
a O
final O
judgement O
tho O
. O

of O
course O
, O
it O
is O
crowded O
but O
who O
cares O
. O

this O
quaint O
and O
romantic O
trattoria O
is O
at O
the O
top O
of O
my O
manhattan O
restaurant O
list O
. O

i've O
been O
there O
three O
times O
and O
have O
always O
had O
wonderful O
experiences O
. O

people O
are O
always O
friendly O
. O

the O
cream B
cheeses B
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
i O
love O
that O
coffee B
! O
! O

from O
the O
entrees B
to O
the O
sides B
to O
the O
drinks B
, O
everything O
was O
creatively O
prepared O
yet O
still O
simple O
. O

hmmm O
. O

service O
was O
prompt O
and O
courteous O
. O

it O
was O
not O
above O
ordinary O
and O
the O
beef B
version B
had O
cheap O
undercooked O
beef B
. O

chance O
is O
a O
small O
cozy O
restaurant O
, O
with O
a O
romantic O
feel O
to O
it O
, O
the O
decor B
is O
great O
. O

it O
was O
nice O
and O
fresh O
, O
but O
i O
can't O
give O
it O
high O
scores O
on O
being O
authentic O
thai B
. O

overall O
, O
worht O
every O
penny O
. O

when O
i O
called O
this O
morning O
, O
i O
didn't O
think O
i O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
<number> O
, O
but O
i O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
, O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O
. O

got O
club B
soda O
, O
filled B
with B
ice O
, O
no B
lime B
. O

only O
wine B
and O
beer B
are O
served B
, O
but O
the O
house B
varities B
are O
actually O
quite O
good O
. O

this O
place O
must O
have O
cost B
the O
owners B
afortune O
to O
build O
. O

my O
mouth O
starts O
to O
water O
merely O
thinking O
about O
the O
delight O
that O
is O
this O
restaurant O
. O

i O
haven't O
been O
to O
the O
other O
locations O
. O

oh O
, O
and O
the O
complimentary O
pudding B
dessert B
was O
just O
enough O
yummy O
! O

people O
dress O
in O
suits O
or O
evening O
gowns O
as O
well O
as O
shirts O
jeans O
. O

we O
split O
a O
tasty O
vegetable B
samosa B
and O
the O
malai B
tikka B
wrap B
. O

knowledge O
of O
the O
chef B
and O
the O
waitress B
are O
below O
average O
. O

we O
were O
walking O
around O
the O
village O
and O
went O
into O
this O
place O
just O
for O
some O
drinks B
. O

decent O
wine B
selection B
too O
. O

go O
with O
a O
group O
of O
friends O
and O
you O
will O
have O
a O
great O
time O
. O

it O
saves O
walking O
in O
and O
waiting B
for O
a O
table B
in O
the O
often O
noisy O
, O
crowded O
bar B
at O
dinnertime O
. O

i O
have O
to O
say O
i O
have O
never O
had O
a O
disapointing O
meal B
here O
. O

it's O
one O
of O
our O
favorite O
places O
to O
eat O
in O
ny O
. O

the O
place O
does O
get O
crowded O
, O
so O
i O
recommend O
going O
between O
<number> O
<number> O
pm O
. O

mine O
was O
a O
little O
burnt O
but O
still O
delicious O
with O
goat B
cheese B
and O
panchetta B
raddichio B
was O
kind O
of O
bitter O
though O
. O

disappointing O
food B
, O
lousy O
service B
. O

i'm O
from O
sichuan O
, O
this O
is O
the O
restaurant O
i O
recommend O
going O
. O

this O
lovely O
french O
asian O
fusion O
restaurant O
stands O
out O
amongst O
other O
great O
restaurants O
on O
smith O
street O
. O

if O
you O
want O
a O
casual O
neighborhood O
bistro O
that O
has O
great O
food B
and O
excellent O
service B
, O
this O
is O
the O
place O
. O

great O
place O
to O
go O
for O
a O
drink B
too O
because O
they O
have O
<number> O
kinds B
of B
beer B
. O

but O
this O
place O
is O
a O
well O
oiled O
machine O
so O
they O
know O
what O
they're O
doing O
. O

over O
price B
, O
and O
small O
portions B
. O

meanwhile O
, O
the O
bartender B
continued O
to O
pour O
champagne B
from O
his O
reserve O
after O
we O
had O
finished O
our O
bottle O
and O
we O
enjoyed O
an O
amuse O
of O
turnip B
soup B
with B
pureed B
basil B
, O
gratis O
. O

but O
i'd O
go O
back O

stepped O
on O
my O
foot O
on O
the O
second O
time O
he O
reached O
over O
me O
to O
adjust O
lighting O
. O

the O
food B
was O
well O
prepared O
and O
the O
service B
impecable O
. O

but O
their O
best O
dish B
is O
thh O
thai O
spiced B
curry B
noodles B
with B
shrimp B
a O
dish B
that O
would O
cost B
<number> O
. O
<number> O
is O
most O
places O
, O
but O
it O
is O
<number> O
here O
. O

good O
, O
dark O
atmosphere B
and O
the O
music B
is O
a O
nice O
touch O
. O

my O
husband O
said O
the O
portions B
were O
very O
small O
, O
but O
if O
my O
main B
course B
was O
good O
to O
eat O
the O
portion B
would've O
been O
fine O
for O
me O
. O

but O
the O
thai B
is O
definitely O
not O
great O
bland O
and O
indistinguished O
. O

this O
thai O
restaurant O
is O
a O
couple O
blocks O
away O
from O
sripraphai O
another O
delicious O
thai O
restaurant O
. O

great O
for O
groups O
, O
great O
for O
a O
date O
, O
great O
for O
early O
brunch B
or O
a O
nightcap B
. O

authentic O
shanghai O
style O
and O
i O
cannot O
recommend O
a O
better O
shanghai O
place O
in O
new O
york O
. O

our O
friendly O
server B
made O
great O
food B
suggestions B
and O
also O
sent O
both O
the O
sommelier B
and O
the O
fromager B
to O
the O
table O
to O
help O
suggest O
different O
pairings O
for O
wine B
and O
cheese B
. O

perhaps O
the O
last O
reviewer O
who O
stated O
she O
was O
treated O
with O
attitude O
lives O
in O
a O
parallel O
universe O
because O
i O
have O
never O
had O
anything O
but O
a O
perfect O
experience O
at O
yasuda O
. O

that O
said O
, O
i O
thought O
scalini O
fedeli O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
dining O
experiences O
i've O
ever O
had O
. O

everything O
about O
this O
restaurant O
was O
special O
. O

because O
we O
didn't O
have O
a O
reservation B
, O
we O
could O
only O
sit O
in O
the O
back B
garden B
, O
but O
it O
was O
great O
, O
secluded O
and O
perfect O
in O
nice O
weather O
. O

stuffing O
yourself O
with O
japanese O
food B
is O
a O
rare O
thing O
. O

i O
try O
my O
best O
to O
give O
an O
accurate O
description O
of O
any O
establishment O
visited O
. O

while O
the O
food B
was O
good O
certainly O
no O
il O
mulino O
the O
service B
was O
horrendous O
. O

it O
is O
expensive O
but O
well O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

service O
is O
not O
what O
one O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
joint O
in O
this O
price B
category B
. O

our O
family O
never O
expected O
such O
incredible O
entertainment B
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
reservations B
on O
weekends O
though O
. O

there O
are O
many O
thai O
places O
in O
the O
city O
but O
so O
far O
toons O
is O
<number> O
. O

great O
pizza B
for O
lunch O
place O
. O

the O
food B
was O
very O
expensive O
we O
spent O
<number> O
for O
lunch B
for O
two O
but O
extremely O
tasty O
. O

i O
don't O
think O
i O
would O
go O
again O
. O

we O
were O
a O
group O
of O
<number> O
and O
well O
seved B
. O

and O
that's O
no O
mean O
feat O
. O
. O
. O

i O
often O
go O
there O
to O
eat O
with O
my O
family O
. O

i O
wish O
they O
would O
change O
back O
to O
what O
it O
was O
before O
. O

the O
signs B
, O
the O
specials B
menus B
, O
food B
, O
and O
even O
all O
the O
waitstaff B
are O
all O
totally O
japanese O
. O

no O
pizza O
<number> O
for O
me O
! O

i O
love O
their O
spicy O
scallop B
roll B
, O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
consistently O
gets O
the O
sesame B
chicken B
. O

i'm O
no O
food B
critic O
, O
but O
i'd O
like O
to O
think O
i O
have O
a O
tiny O
bit O
of O
experience O
under O
my O
belt O
having O
lived O
in O
ny O
for O
the O
last O
<number> O
years O
. O

i O
noted O
it O
was O
crossed O
off O
on O
the O
bill B
. O

needless O
to O
say O
, O
i'm O
never O
going O
back O
and O
you O
should O
be O
wary O
too O
. O

best O
dish B
is O
nori O
wrapped O
tuna B
. O

the O
food B
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
! O
! O

some O
servers B
make O
you O
feel O
like O
they O
are O
doing O
you O
a O
favor O
to O
bring O
you O
the O
food B
. O

an O
excellent O
alternative O
to O
fast B
food B
joints O
and O
ordering O
in O
but O
, O
the O
food B
was O
slightly O
disappointing O
. O

mermaid O
inn O
is O
an O
overall O
good O
restaurant O
with O
really O
good O
seafood B
. O

i O
work O
around O
the O
corner O
and O
tried O
it O
with O
a O
colleague O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

i O
went O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
and O
another O
couple O
. O

the O
staff B
is O
also O
attentive O
and O
friendly O
. O

the O
all B
you B
can B
eat B
deal B
is O
truly O
amazing O
here O
. O

that O
is O
a O
problem O
since O
we O
paid O
about O
<number> O
bucks O
a O
dish B
, O
and O
had O
to O
order O
<number> O
dishes B
to O
get O
a O
decent O
taste B
. O

this O
is O
definitely O
a O
place O
that O
provides O
the O
best O
experience O
, O
though O
, O
to O
both O
a O
listers O
and O
people O
walking O
in O
off O
the O
street O
. O

they O
were O
such O
a O
rip O
off O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
for O
four O
small O
meat B
patties B
in B
steamed B
buns B
and O
not O
worth O
trying O
. O

first O
it O
took O
us O
a O
long O
time O
to O
find O
the O
place O
. O

all O
of O
the O
pizzas B
are O
terrific O
and O
the O
price B
is O
even O
better O
! O

it O
is O
about O
food O
and O
ambiance O
, O
and O
imagine O
how O
dreadful O
it O
will O
be O
it O
we O
only O
had O
to O
listen O
to O
an O
idle O
engine O
. O

the O
food B
was O
good O
too O
. O

we O
have O
tried O
every O
thai O
restaurant O
between O
atlantic O
avenue O
and O
4th O
streets O
, O
and O
joya O
is O
the O
best O
. O

immediately O
after O
we O
paid O
, O
the O
waiter B
took O
the O
money O
and O
said O
, O
okay O
, O
you O
guys O
are O
outta O
here O
. O

the O
dining B
room B
is O
quietly O
elegant O
with O
no O
music B
to O
shout O
over O
how O
refreshing O
! O

admittedly O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
for O
gigantic O
pieces O
of O
fish B
overflowing O
the O
plate O
and O
thank O
goodness O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
but O
for O
simple O
, O
elegant O
sushi B
there O
is O
no O
better O
place O
in O
new O
york O
or O
anywhere O
in O
the O
us O
. O

i O
am O
a O
die O
hard O
peep O
lover O
. O

once O
you O
become O
a O
regular O
, O
you O
are O
treated O
as O
one O
. O

the O
menu B
seemed O
to O
have O
a O
wide O
variety B
of B
dishes B
for O
seafood B
lovers O
and O
interesting O
ways O
of B
preparing O
them O
. O

everyone O
treats O
you O
like O
you O
were O
part O
of O
the O
family O
. O

the O
white B
bean B
brushetta B
to O
start O
was O
incredible O
and O
the O
pasta B
was O
phenomenal O
. O

the O
rest O
of O
the O
menu B
is O
limited O
by O
everything O
is O
good O
eats B
. O

the O
menu B
is O
nothing O
like O
the O
one O
on O
the O
website O
. O

great O
food B
, O
great O
lay B
out B
and O
awesome O
service B
. O

ive O
asked O
a O
cart B
attendant B
for O
a O
lotus B
leaf B
wrapped B
rice B
and O
she O
replied O
back O
rice B
and O
just O
walked O
away O
. O

sea O
has O
become O
so O
popular O
that O
they've O
let O
it O
go O
to O
their O
heads O
. O

we O
walked O
in O
on O
a O
wednesday O
night O
and O
were O
seated B
promptly O
. O

chennai O
garden O
is O
my O
favorite O
indian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
. O

the O
wait B
staff B
is O
very O
freindly O
, O
they O
make O
it O
feel O
like O
you're O
eating O
in O
a O
freindly O
little O
european O
town O
. O

oh O
yeah O
ever O
on O
the O
west O
side O
try O
there O
sister O
resturant O
arties O
cafe O
. O

besides O
that O
there O
should O
be O
more O
restaurants O
like O
it O
around O
the O
city O
. O

my O
roommate O
and O
i O
love O
this O
place O
. O

the O
waitstaff B
are O
all O
very O
busy O
, O
it's O
not O
outstanding O
service B
, O
but O
i've O
never O
been O
dealt O
with O
rudely O
. O

i O
have O
lived O
in O
japan O
for O
<number> O
years O
and O
the O
taste B
of O
the O
food B
and O
the O
feel B
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
like O
being O
back O
in O
japan O
. O

not O
worth O
it O
. O

in O
the O
evening O
, O
this O
place O
attracted O
a O
well O
dressed O
, O
with O
it O
, O
ny O
crowd O
. O

they O
have O
it O
all O
great O
price B
, O
food B
, O
and O
service B
. O

so O
close O
, O
but O
not O
good O
enough O
. O

this O
was O
on O
a O
tuesday O
night O
. O

its O
also O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
hassle O
to O
get O
to O
without O
a O
car O
i O
happen O
to O
live O
in O
inwood O
. O

the O
flavors B
are O
great O
, O
and O
the O
menu B
is O
extensive O
. O

the O
food B
was O
amazing O
, O
the O
service B
was O
so O
attentive O
and O
personable O
, O
and O
how O
about O
that O
ambience B
! O

this O
place B
has O
the O
best O
interior B
i O
have O
seen O
anywhere O
in O
the O
northside O
of O
w'burg O
, O
and O
will O
impress O
whoever O
you O
bring O
there O
. O

the O
food B
has O
been O
consistant O
for O
years O
and O
it O
never O
lets O
you O
down O
. O

i O
found O
the O
variety O
of O
the O
sashimi B
plate B
to O
be O
satisfying O
fresh O
and O
yummy O
. O

and O
forget O
what O
you O
read O
under O
me O
, O
the O
atmosphere B
isn't O
that O
bad O
either O
. O

don't O
waste O
your O
time O
, O
or O
money O
! O
! O

they O
don't O
concern O
much O
of O
customer's O
health O
, O
just O
want O
to O
make O
money O
. O

we O
couldn't O
carry O
our O
conversation O
as O
we O
were O
routinely O
interrupted O
by O
waitress B
and O
servants B
asking O
us O
to O
order O
and O
hinting O
that O
we're O
taking O
too O
much O
time O
amazing O
, O
we O
just O
sat O
down O
. O

sometimes O
i O
get O
good O
food B
and O
ok O
service B
. O

we O
just O
ate O
at O
kai O
and O
were O
disapointed O
. O

it's O
a O
place O
for O
people O
who O
pay O
a O
lot O
for O
mediocre O
food B
, O
noise B
and O
a O
chance O
to O
be O
with O
their O
fellow O
bridge O
and O
tunnel O
folks O
. O

this O
was O
a O
great O
surprise O
. O

after O
complaining O
about O
the O
chicken B
dish B
, O
the O
manager B
came O
over O
to O
tell O
us O
that O
, O
no O
one O
had O
ever O
complained O
before O
, O
and O
that O
we O
just O
didn't O
know O
what O
the O
dish B
was O
supposed O
to O
taste O
like O
. O

the O
food B
was O
spicy O
and O
delicious O
. O

i O
went O
with O
my O
fiance O
on O
a O
tuesday O
evening O
. O

a O
little O
overpriced O
but O
worth O
it O
once O
you O
take O
a O
bite O
. O

it O
was O
wonderful O
. O

went O
for O
a O
late O
weekday O
lunch B
. O

i O
just O
don't O
understand O
all O
the O
hype O
. O
. O
. O

bartender O
was O
unable O
to O
tear O
himself O
away O
from O
friends O
at O
bar B
. O

anyways O
, O
if O
you're O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
to O
eat O
good O
food B
, O
i O
wouldn't O
waste O
my O
time O
trying O
to O
find O
something O
, O
rather O
go O
across O
the O
street O
to O
tamari O
. O

dahkin O
also O
offers O
prix B
fixe B
lunch B
and O
buffet B
. O

although O
the O
place B
could O
be O
a O
little O
more O
eye O
catching O
and O
roomier O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
it O
doesn't O
really O
matter O
. O

you O
can O
barely O
see O
who O
you O
are O
with O
never O
mind O
have O
a O
conversation O
. O

this O
was O
my O
frist O
time O
at O
cafe O
st O
. O
bart's O
and O
i O
must O
say O
how O
delicous O
the O
food B
and O
the O
service B
was O
. O

i O
don't O
get O
it O
either O
. O

went O
on O
a O
double O
date O
with O
friend O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
for O
a O
few O
drinks B
and O
appetizers B
. O

great O
place O
to O
grab O
a O
hot B
bagel B
on O
the O
way O
to O
work O
. O

it's O
like O
they O
took O
leftover O
chicken B
, O
poured O
oil B
and O
sprinkled O
pepper B
powder B
over O
it O
the O
sauce B
was O
translucent O
and O
red O
. O

one O
would O
think O
we'd O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks B
instead O
, O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter B
wouldn't O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
<number> O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O
. O

one O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in O
manhattan O
. O

they O
brought O
glasses O
and O
the O
bottle O
, O
and O
just O
left O
the O
bottle O
at O
our O
table O
. O

we O
actually O
gave O
<number> O
tip B
which O
we O
have O
never O
done O
despite O
mediocre O
food B
and O
service B
, O
because O
we O
felt O
totally O
ripped O
off O
. O

we O
were O
looking O
forward O
to O
nice O
glass B
of B
sangria O
when O
we O
arrived O
. O

i O
would O
highly O
recommand O
requesting O
a O
table B
by B
the B
window B
. O

while O
we O
enjoyed O
the O
food B
, O
we O
were O
highly O
disappointed O
by O
the O
poor O
service B
waiter B
was O
not O
quite O
competent O
and O
slow O
service B
and O
lack O
of O
remorse O
. O

i O
for O
one O
will O
never O
patronize O
them O
again O
. O

i O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria O
as O
i O
explored O
my O
new O
neighborhood O
. O

after O
hearing O
a O
lot O
of O
great O
things O
about O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
passing O
by O
it O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
try O
. O

the O
service B
, O
however O
, O
was O
a O
bright O
flower O
in O
a O
garden O
. O

so O
, O
again O
, O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O

stay O
far O
away O
from O
this O
place O
. O

we O
will O
come O
back O
! O
! O
! O

we've O
been O
to O
grocery O
three O
times O
and O
not O
once O
has O
an O
item O
on O
the O
menu B
disappointed O
. O

the O
food B
is O
very O
good O
too O
but O
for O
the O
most O
part O
, O
it's O
just O
regular O
food B
, O
nothing O
special O
. O

a O
touch O
more O
jalapeno B
heat O
for O
contrast O
and O
it O
would O
have O
been O
very O
good O
indeed O
. O

tried O
the O
pad B
see B
ew B
on O
the O
recommendation O
of O
the O
last O
reviewer O
since O
it's O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
dishes B
. O

we'd O
go O
back O
again O

we O
ate O
out O
in O
the O
back B
patio B
, O
which O
is O
worth O
it O
as O
it's O
cool O
and O
the O
music B
is O
hear O
well O
there O
. O

the O
location B
is O
perfect O
. O

guacamole O
shrimp O
appetizer B
was O
really O
great O
, O
we O
both O
had O
the O
filet B
, O
very O
good O
, O
didn't O
much O
like O
the O
frites B
that O
came O
with O
, O
but O
the O
filet B
was O
so O
good O
, O
neither O
of O
us O
cared O
. O

the O
lunch B
special B
is O
an O
asbolute O
steal O
. O

this O
food B
is O
asian O
air O
fusion O
. O

nothing O
fancy O
but O
really O
good O
food B
with O
pretty O
reasonable O
price B
. O

the O
chicken B
pot B
pie B
is O
excpetiona O
, O
the O
cheeseburger B
huge O
and O
delictable O
, O
and O
the O
service B
professional O
wan O
warm O
. O

while O
i O
quite O
liked O
the O
food B
and O
the O
ambience B
, O
i'm O
not O
quite O
sure O
if O
it O
they O
really O
deserve O
it O
the O
michelin O
rating O
they O
have O
displayed O
so O
prooudly O
in O
the O
window O
. O

i'm O
surprised O
about O
some O
of O
the O
bad O
reviews O
posted O
here O
i've O
been O
to O
tamarind O
about O
<number> O
or O
<number> O
times O
and O
always O
come O
away O
extremely O
satisfied O
and O
looking O
forward O
to O
returning O
. O

but O
on O
a O
lazy O
saturday O
night O
, O
we O
ended O
up O
going O
. O

there O
are O
a O
few O
italian O
employees B
who O
may O
not O
speak O
the O
best O
english O
but O
for O
me O
that O
adds O
to O
the O
experience O
. O

i O
have O
never O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant O
, O
however O
, O
upon O
reading O
the O
reviews O
i O
got O
take O
out O
last O
week O
. O

once O
for O
dinner B
and O
once O
for O
brunch B
. O

i've O
been O
to O
at O
cafe O
spice O
probably O
<number> O
<number> O
times O
, O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best O
indian O
restaurant O
around O
union O
square O
. O

not O
worth O
the O
prices B
. O

would O
recommend O
perfect O
for O
those O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
close O
to O
grand O
central O
. O

from O
the O
moment O
you O
enter O
till O
the O
moment O
you O
walk O
out O
the O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
staff B
was O
was O
just O
fantastic O
. O

service O
was O
good O
and O
food B
is O
wonderful O
. O

i O
only O
have O
friends O
. O

she O
gets O
<number> O
for O
her O
excellent O
service B
and O
advice O
. O

the O
restaurant O
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
but O
that O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
once O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
enjoy O
a O
great O
meal B

being O
a O
fan O
of O
spicy B
ethnic B
foods B
, O
indian O
included O
, O
i O
made O
friends O
with O
this O
place O
long O
ago O
. O

please O
save O
yourself O
the O
frustration O
. O

and O
i O
say O
snacking B
because O
it O
really O
is O
not O
set O
up O
to O
be O
a O
proper O
dinner B
. O

the O
quality B
of B
food B
at O
this O
restaurant O
accompanied O
by O
fantastic O
live B
jazz B
makes O
this O
place O
a O
perfect O
<number> O
! O

i O
have O
eaten O
at O
saul O
, O
many O
times O
, O
the O
food B
is O
always O
consistently O
, O
outrageously O
good O
. O

always O
ask O
the O
bartender B
for O
the O
seasonal O
beer B
! O
! O
! O

if O
your O
visiting O
, O
you'll O
enjoy O
the O
ambiance B
and O
the O
fact O
that O
it's O
in O
time O
sq O
. O
. O
. O

we O
were O
on O
our O
way O
back O
to O
nj O
, O
and O
since O
i O
am O
in O
ny O
, O
we O
figured O
why O
not O
grab O
some O
food B
? O

sandwiches B
tho O
pricey O
are O
over O
stuffed O
can O
serve O
<number> O
persons O
easily O
thus O
cost O
effective O
! O

and O
comparing O
it O
to O
the O
chinatown O
restaurants O
is O
simply O
not O
fair O
. O

service O
and O
food B
is O
what O
any O
one O
would O
expect O
when O
spending O
that O
type O
of O
money O
. O

love O
the O
atmosphere B
felt O
like O
i O
was O
in O
paris O
. O

every O
course B
was O
better O
than O
the O
next O
. O

not O
cheap O
, O
but O
not O
that O
expensive O
either O
. O

the O
staff B
is O
incredibly O
helpful O
and O
attentive O
. O

if O
presentation O
and O
service B
is O
your O
thing O
, O
then O
this O
magic O
show O
works O
. O

apparently O
, O
the O
good O
cook B
works O
then O
. O

i O
was O
pleasantly O
suprised O
. O

the O
yellowtail O
was O
particularly O
good O
as O
well O
. O

one O
less O
manhattanite O
the O
better O
. O

everyone O
is O
welcomed O
in O
as O
family O
. O

i O
ate O
clams B
oreganta B
and B
spectacular O
salad B
with B
perfectly B
marinated B
cucumbers B
and B
tomatoes B
with B
lots B
of B
shrimp B
and B
basil B
. O

the O
menu B
changed O
, O
portions B
were O
even O
smaller O
than O
before O
, O
a O
lentil B
dish B
was O
salty O
beyond O
edibility O
, O
a O
basmati B
rice B
dish B
lacked O
flavor B
. O

spice O
is O
sleek O
, O
modern O
and O
cool O
with O
a O
menu B
that O
will O
not O
hurt O
your O
wallet O
. O

patroon O
features O
a O
nice O
cigar B
bar B
and O
has O
great O
staff B
. O

hey O
, O
i O
think O
<number> O
for O
a O
<number> O
block O
walk O
ain't O
bad O
. O

very O
affordable O
and O
excellent O
ambient B
! O

look O
elsewhere O
. O

more O
important O
, O
the O
sushi B
rivals O
the O
best O
in O
tokyo O
. O

i O
have O
never O
had O
cheescake B
like O
this O
. O

bill O
a O
little O
high O
, O
but O
worth O
it O
. O

i O
seriously O
doubt O
i O
will O
ever O
dine O
at O
jimmy's O
bronx O
, O
or O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
jimmy's O
uptown O
, O
again O
. O

everyone O
i O
bring O
here O
always O
loves O
it O
. O

my O
co O
workers O
had O
to O
wait O
almost O
an O
hour O
for O
delivery B
, O
only O
to O
discover O
that O
what O
they O
got O
was O
not O
what O
they O
ordered O
. O

worth O
a O
visit O
. O

a O
real O
dissapointment O
. O

its O
a O
go O
to O
for O
dates O
as O
well O
as O
entertaining B
out O
of O
town O
guests O
. O

why O
do O
people O
rave O
about O
the O
ambience B
. O

were O
meeting O
up O
with O
some O
friends O
for O
a O
drink B
at O
lafayette O
<number> O
and O
happened O
to O
walk O
by O
thai O
angel O
famished O
. O

fluke O
sashimi B
drizzled O
with O
jalapeno O
lime O
olive B
oil B
, O
the B
fruit B
of B
the B
oil B
nicely O
highlighting O
the B
fish's O
sweetness O
. O

great O
sushi B
experience O
. O

if O
you're O
looking O
for O
a O
great O
meal B
at O
a O
decent O
price B
, O
go O
to O
del O
frisco's O
! O

they O
charge O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
for O
rice B
. O

my O
steak B
au B
poivre B
was O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
i've O
had O
. O

on O
a O
recent O
sunday O
afternoon O
, O
a O
friend O
and O
i O
accidently O
found O
this O
great O
restaurant O
on O
our O
way O
to O
see O
the O
pulitzer O
prize O
winning O
play O
doubt O
. O

the O
owner B
and O
staff B
are O
all O
japanese O
as O
well O
and O
that O
adds O
to O
the O
entire O
ambiance B
. O

try O
the O
congee B
and O
the O
donut B
like B
deep B
fried B
dough B
they B
call B
ow O
ley O
soh O
, O
a O
delicious O
and O
sweet O
tasting O
bread B
. O

although O
the O
tables B
may O
be O
closely O
situated O
, O
the O
candle O
light O
, O
food O
quality O
and O
service B
overcompensate O
. O

the O
food B
was O
delicious O
and O
the O
waiter B
was O
incredibly O
helpful O
and O
attentive O
considering O
we O
were O
the O
only O
ones O
there O
for O
the O
first O
hour O
. O

from O
the O
spectacular O
caviar B
to O
the O
hospitable O
waitstaff B
, O
i O
felt O
like O
royalty O
and O
enjoyed O
every O
second O
of O
it O
. O

i O
will O
be O
going O
back O
and O
heartily O
recommend O
it O
! O

would O
definitely O
visit O
again O
. O

definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
to O
battery O
park O
city O
! O

perhaps O
this O
food B
is O
considered O
extreme O
to O
an O
upper O
east O
side O
resident O
, O
but O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
who've O
actually O
eaten O
ethnic B
food B
, O
this O
is O
simply O
dull O
. O

the O
place B
was O
real O
empty O
but O
that O
was O
because O
this O
was O
the O
first O
sunday O
they O
ever O
opened O
. O

this O
little O
place B
definitely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
and O
you O
sure O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
food B
for O
your O
money B
. O

ambience O
is O
delightful O
, O
service B
impeccable O
. O

service O
was O
excellent O
, O
and O
the O
ac O
worked O
very O
well O
too O
thank O
god O
, O
it O
was O
hot O
! O
. O

tasty O
but O
expensive O
. O

you O
get O
the O
sense O
that O
the O
people B
there O
care O
about O
their O
restaurant O
and O
about O
your O
experience O
and O
that O
is O
very O
nice O
. O

both O
are O
delicious O
, O
the O
cooks B
are O
friendly O
and O
are O
willing O
to O
take O
a O
moment O
and O
speak O
to O
you O
and O
shake O
your O
hand O
. O

so O
i O
thought O
why O
not O
change O
it O
up O
a O
bit O
. O

my O
friend O
ordered O
some O
of O
their O
special O
sushi B
rolls B
which O
had O
excellent O
presentation O
and O
tasted O
great O
! O

although O
be O
warned O
their O
dinner B
menu B
to B
sit B
and O
take B
out B
prices B
are O
different O
. O

the O
staff B
was O
accomodating O
, O
the O
food B
was O
absolutely O
delicious O
and O
the O
place B
is O
lovely O
. O

p O
. O
s O
. O
please O
don't O
tell O
anyone O
in O
my O
family O
i O
eat O
there O
. O

my O
picks O
are O
scallion O
pancake O
fried O
with O
vegetable B
juice B
, O
very O
special O
and O
tasty O
guizhou O
chicken O
shredded O
squid O
family O
style O
one O
of O
my O
personal O
favorites O
sichuan O
spicy O
soft O
shell O
crab O
shuizhu O
fish O
this O
one O
is O
for O
hardcore O
sichuan O
food B
fans O
, O
i O
wouldn't O
recommend O
to O
my O
american O
friends O
as O
it's O
very O
spicy O
. O

they O
smell O
like O
they O
stuff O
them O
with O
old O
canned B
vegetables B
like O
the O
spinach B
mushroom B
calzone B
. O

to O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
, O
three O
of O
us O
went O
to O
mare O
anticipating O
great O
food B
. O

there O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
for O
<number> O
blue O
point O
oysters B
and O
a O
beer B
or O
glass B
of B
wine B
for O
<number> O
! O

i O
really O
liked O
the O
noodle B
dishes B
at O
rice O
avenue O
compared O
to O
their O
green O
curry O
dish B
. O

i O
went O
to O
pams O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
, O
and O
i O
love O
it O
. O

but O
for O
whatever O
reason O
, O
prices B
are O
about O
twice O
as O
high O
. O

i O
am O
relatively O
new O
to O
the O
area O
and O
tried O
pick O
a O
bgel O
on O
2nd O
and O
was O
disappointed O
with O
the O
service B
and O
i O
thought O
the O
food B
was O
overated O
and O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
. O

great O
atmoshere B
and O
worth O
every O
bit O
. O

we O
had O
a O
most O
unpleasant O
experience O
at O
this O
restaurant O
. O

the O
spicy B
tuna B
roll B
was O
unusually O
good O
and O
the O
rock B
shrimp B
tempura B
was O
awesome O
, O
great O
appetizer B
to O
share O
! O

the O
staff B
was O
knowledgeable O
and O
full O
of O
personality O
. O

great O
staff B
. O

only O
complaint O
would O
be O
that O
at O
an O
average O
cost B
of O
<number> O
<number> O
per O
meal B
, O
i'd O
like O
not O
to O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
finding O
a O
seat B
! O

to O
finish O
off O
such O
a O
delightful O
dinner B
experience O
you O
must O
have O
dessert B
, O
especially O
the O
white O
chocolate B
bread O
pudding O
with B
gelato O
and B
hot B
chocolate B
. O

the O
banana B
tower B
is O
an O
amazing O
dessert B
as O
well O
. O

i O
went O
there O
with O
my O
friend O
last O
saturday O
. O

excellent O
atmosphere B
, O
delicious O
dishes B
good O
and O
friendly O
service B
. O

a O
cool O
place B
to O
hang O
with O
your O
friends O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
healthy O
drinks B
and O
desserts B
. O

great O
vibe B
, O
lots O
of O
people O
. O

i O
like O
mamoun's O
food B
as O
well O
, O
but O
side O
by O
side O
, O
kati O
rolls O
just O
produce O
tastier O
food B
hands O
down O
. O

just O
an O
odd O
group O
. O

the O
service B
is O
a O
bit O
slow O
, O
but O
harkens O
back O
to O
my O
years O
growing O
up O
in O
napoli O
, O
italy O
where O
things O
are O
not O
rushed O
and O
when O
you O
sit O
down O
for O
dinner B
the O
table B
is O
yours O
all O
night O
. O

either O
that O
, O
or O
the O
editor's O
idea O
of O
romance O
must O
be O
sharing O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
next O
table O
, O
while O
trying O
to O
speak O
louder O
than O
the O
traffic O
on O
57th O
. O

i O
love O
this O
place O
! O

it O
is O
not O
consistent O
. O

but O
that O
wasn't O
the B
icing B
on B
the B
cake B
a O
tiramisu B
that O
resembled O
nothing O
i O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

great O
food B
and O
the O
prices B
are O
very O
reasonable O
. O

wine O
list B
is O
not O
huge O
but O
def O
well O
selected O
. O

a O
cool O
bar B
with O
great O
food B
, O
and O
tons O
of O
excellent O
beer B
. O

be O
sure O
to O
try O
the O
seasonal O
, O
and O
always O
delicious O
, O
specials B
. O

the O
ambience B
is O
authentic O
and O
relaxing O
and O
we O
have O
always O
received O
attentive O
and O
prompt O
service B
. O

fresh O
, O
authentic O
, O
french B
cuisine B
in O
substantial O
portions B
. O

drinks O
got O
screwed O
up O
, O
she O
acted O
put O
upon O
. O

the O
one O
vegetarian B
entree B
abby's O
treasure B
was O
actually O
quite O
a O
surprise O
it O
was O
delicious O
and B
had O
wintermelon B
covering O
an O
assortment B
of B
fresh B
mushrooms B
and B
vegetables B
. O

at O
<number> O
dumplings B
for O
<number> O
, O
you O
just O
cannot O
go O
wrong O
. O

but O
the O
pizza B
is O
way O
to O
expensive O
. O

and O
the O
staff B
is O
also O
young O
, O
energeic O
and O
hot O
! O
! O
! O
! O

even O
better O
, O
they O
know O
how O
to O
cook O
french O
classics O
like O
steak O
au B
poivre O
and O
onglet O
without O
burning O
it O
to O
death O
or O
overcooking O
it O
. O

service O
was O
decent O
, O
but O
not O
as O
smooth O
as O
i O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
place O
with O
these O
prices B
and O
reputation B
. O

we O
had O
a O
wonderful O
meal B
at O
naples O
<number> O
a O
month O
ago O
on O
a O
visit O
to O
nyc O
. O

, O
very O
friendly O
and B
no O
nonsense O
service B
and B
a O
clean O

funky O
bathroom B
. O

was O
there O
friday O
night O
. O

we O
had O
a O
girls' O
night O
dinner B
here O
for O
restaurant O
week O
. O

romantic O
if O
you O
want O
it O
to O
be O
brightly O
lit O
. O

however O
, O
i O
was O
there O
for O
a O
work O
dinner B
not O
long O
ago O
when O
my O
colleague O
from O
london O
noticed O
a O
very O
large O
waterbug O
on O
the O
ceiling B
. O

i O
recommend O
it O
! O

i O
have O
taken O
practically O
every O
guest O
that O
has O
come O
to O
visit O
me O
in O
ny O
and O
hooked O
a O
few O
new O
yorkers O
onto O

my O
chow B
fun B
and B
chow B
see B

really O
bland O
and B
oily O
. O

even O
though O
i O
made O
the O
reservation B
at O
3pm O
for O
the O
same O
night O
through O
dinnerbroker O
, O
we O
were O
seated B
at O
a O
table B
with O
one O
of O
the O
best O
view O
! O

we O
did O
notice O
however O
, O
that O
some O
tables O
had O
what O
looked O
like O
pita B
instead O
of O
naan B
. O

i O
didn't O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
rest O
menu B
, O
but O
the O
oysters B
were O
fantastic O
. O

after O
the O
review O
i O
treked O
into O
brooklyn O
. O

the O
grilled B
cheese B
at O
home O
afterwards O
was O
better O
. O
! O
! O

we O
were O
pleasantly O
greeted O
. O

the O
red O
sliding O
doors B
may O
be O
unique O
but O
they O
do O
not O
block O
off O
the O
cold O
air O
from O
the O
outside O
. O

great O
service B
, O
great O
food B
. O

the O
food B
is O
expensive O
, O
but O
worth O
every O
bite O
. O

sometimes O
i O
get O
bad O
food B
and O
bad O
service B
, O
sometimes O
i O
get O
good B
good B
and O
bad O
service B
. O

when O
we O
were O
finally O
seated O
our O
waitress B
came O
by O
twice O

for O
our O
order O

love O
this O
place B

good O
, O
fast O
service B

dakshin O
is O
one O
of O
the O
few O
affordable O
and O
tasty O
indian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
upper O
east O
side O
. O

they O
charge O
different O
prices B
all O
the O
time O
. O

to O
dine O
at O
thalia O
can O
be O
slightly O
deceiving O
because O
while O
its O
beautiful O
on O
the O
outside O
, O
its O
so O
bland O
on O
the O
inside O
. O

i O
was O
in O
love O
with O
pongsri O
on O
48th O
, O
but O
compared O
to O
suan O
it O
is O
slow O
in O
service B
and O
overpriced O
. O

my O
friends O
and O
i O
experienced O
amazing O
cheese B
and O
a O
delicious O
, O
new O
summer O
menu B
at O
artisanal O
last O
night O
. O

i O
am O
so O
coming O
back O
here O
again O
, O
as O
much O
as O
i O
can O
. O

i O
have O
been O
going O
back O
again O
and O
again O
. O

it's O
charmingly O
small O
and O
that O
leads O
to O
an O
atmoshere B
that O
is O
extremely O
cozy O
and O
romantic O
, O
even O
. O

it O
is O
obvious O
that O
no O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
has O
any O
idea O
about O
or O
experience O
with O
japanese O
cuisine B
. O

in O
terms O
of O
the O
food B
itself O
nothing O
special O
, O
we O
limited O
ourselves O
to O
several O
appetizers B
. O

love O
the O
jazz O
bands B
on O
fri O
and O
sat O
. O

overall O
, O
excellent O
restaurant O
! O

to O
begin O
, O
we O
were O
told O
there O
was O
a O
<number> O
minute O
wait B
and O
started O
to O
leave O
, O
when O
the O
hostess B
offered O
to O
call O
us O
on O
our O
cell O
phone O
when O
the O
table B
was O
ready O
. O

the O
servers B
give O
you O
some O
sample O
slices O
of O
your O
order O
while O
you O
wait O
shortly O
i O
might O
add O
. O

the O
service B
was O
ok O
. O

when O
asked O
about O
how O
a O
certain O
dish B
was O
prepared O
in O
comparison O
to O
a O
similar O
at O
other O
thai O
restaurants O
, O
he O
replied O
this O
is O
not O
mcdonald's O
, O
every O
place O
makes O
things O
differently O
while O
it O
is O
understandable O
that O
every O
place O
is O
indeed O
different O
, O
there O
was O
not O
a O
need O
to O
be O
uncourteous O
to O
customers O
and O
downright O
rude O
. O

i O
ate O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time O
and O
absolutely O
loved O
it O
! O

don't O
expect O
to O
sit O
down O
inside O
though O
, O
there O
are O
only O
a O
few O
tables B
and O
they O
are O
always O
full O
. O

the O
staff B
is O
accomodating O
, O
the O
ambiance B
is O
exciting O
and O
yet O
relaxed O
, O
and O
the O
food B
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
! O

the O
food B
was O
delicious O
i O
had O
a O
halibut B
special B
, O
my O
husband O
had O
steak B
, O
and O
the O
service B
was O
top O
notch O
. O

the O
manager B
claimed O
that O
he O
could O
not O
compensate O
us O
for O
anything O
on O
the O
bill B
which O
just O
shows O
the O
lack O
of O
sophistication O
from O
the O
entire O
group O
. O

this O
is O
by O
far O
my O
favorite O
place O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

but O
too O
far O
east O
! O

satisfying O
. O

highly O
highly O
highly O
recommended O
! O

it's O
the O
only O
place O
you O
can O
get O
yummy O
authentic O
japanese B
comfort B
food B
. O

we O
took O
advanatage O
of O
the O
half B
price B
sushi B
deal B
on O
saturday O
so O
it O
was O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

we O
came O
here O
on O
a O
crowded O
saturday O
night O
and O
were O
seated B
right O
away O
despite O
being O
<number> O
minutes O
late O
for O
our O
reservation B
. O

this O
place O
is O
cool O
enough O
to O
be O
in O
the O
east O
village O
, O
but O
french O
enough O
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
could O
be O
in O
a O
bistro O
in O
a O
back O
alley O
in O
paris O
. O

we O
were O
fast O
to O
order O
the O
appetizer B
platter B
since O
we O
were O
very O
hungry O
. O

the O
staff B
are O
attentive O
, O
and O
have O
smiles O
on O
their O
faces O
. O

this O
is O
the O
best O
shabu O
shabu O
restaurant O
in O
the O
try O
state O
area O
. O

no O
dress B
codes B
, O
no O
attitudes B
, O
plenty O
of O
comfort O
companionship O
, O
a O
great O
place B
to O
relax O
in O
an O
always O
busy O
midtown O
. O

largest O
and O
freshest O
pieces B
of B
sushi B
, O
and O
delicious O
! O

even O
the O
pasta B
is O
delicious O
here O
a O
rarity O
in O
new O
york O
pizza O
restaurants O
. O

but O
when O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu B
, O
there O
weren't O
a O
lot O
of O
choices O
, O
most O
of O
them O
were O
dumplings B
in O
the O
appetizer B
section O
. O

maybe O
i O
say O
so O
because O
it O
looked O
promising O
for O
people O
who O
like O
artery O
clogging O
jewish B
deli B
food B
, O
but O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
poorly O
run O
and O
awful O
. O

after O
my O
3rd O
time O
the O
manager B
remembered O
me O
and O
treated O
me O
like O
an O
usual O
customer O
. O

this O
place O
is O
greatly O
welcome O
in O
the O
desolate O
little O
strip O
between O
the O
prospect O
expressway O
and O
greenwood O
cemetery O
a O
wasteland O
we O
like O
to O
call O
the O
sliv O
. O

now O
if O
they O
could O
only O
get O
a O
toaster B
. O

you O
will O
find O
yourself O
returning O
quite O
often O
. O

when O
he's O
not O
making O
authentic O
neapolitan O
pizza B
in O
the O
open O
brick O
oven O
or O
lightly O
frying O
zucchini B
blossoms B
, O
he's O
visiting O
the O
regulars O
a O
growing O
legion O
and O
checking O
on O
newcomers O
. O

wait O
staff B
is O
blantently O
unappreciative O
of O
your O
business O
but O
its O
the O
best O
pie B
on O
the O
uws O
! O

the O
ingredients B
taste O
fresher O
, O
the O
crust B
is O
thinner O
and O
crispier O
, O
the O
slice B
is O
less O
oily O
, O
and O
it's O
never O
burnt O
like O
it O
occasionally O
is O
at O
joe's O
. O

fish O
is O
so O
very O
fresh O
. O

the O
prices B
were O
cheap O
compared O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
service B
and O
food B
. O

go O
only O
if O
you O
are O
already O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
don't O
want O
to O
bother O
going O
farther O
for O
a O
better O
place O
. O

top O
spot O
in O
town O
for O
vietnamese O
classics B
, O
better O
than O
places O
that O
cost O
a O
lot O
more O
. O

less O
wait B
time B
for O
me O
! O

this O
was O
the O
perfect O
quiet O
, O
relaxing O
, O
and O
delicious O
accompaniment O
to O
our O
afternoon O
of O
theater O
. O

the O
decor B
is O
really O
blah O
, O
and O
not O
at O
all O
hip O
or O
happening O
. O

having O
discovered O
ping's O
on O
the O
internet O
, O
we O
entered O
with O
qualms O
but O
were O
instantly O
put O
to O
ease O
by O
the O
fish B
tanks B
that O
greet O
you O
as O
u O
walk O
in O
. O

you O
cannot O
go O
wrong O
at O
the O
red O
eye O
grill O
. O

it O
appears O
to O
be O
the O
owner's O
first O
venture O
and O
it O
shows O
. O

i O
come O
from O
a O
family O
of O
pizzeria O
owners O
, O
and O
i'm O
almost O
ashamed O
to O
say O
that O
the O
pizza B
in O
fornino's O
blows O
my O
families O
receipies O
away O
. O

i O
go O
twice O
a O
month O
! O

we O
ordered O
some O
beef B
and O
noodle B
soup B
dishes B
from O
the O
thai O
section O
of O
the O
menu B
but O
nothing O
we O
got O
was O
thai O
. O

they O
have O
a O
huge O
selection O
of O
different O
cream B
cheeses B
and O
all O
of O
their O
salads B
are O
great O
. O

the O
lobster B
sandwich B
is O
good O
and B
the O
spaghetti B
with B
scallops O
and B
shrimp O
is O
great O
. O

the O
food B
was O
authentic O
. O

the O
dim B
sum B
is O
delectable O
while O
the O
prices B
are O
quite O
easy O
on O
the O
wallet O
. O

i O
only O
tried O
a B
simple O
dish B
of O
spinach B
ravioli B
in B
a B
light B
oil B
and B
garlic B
sauce B
, O
but O
it O
actually O
faired O
better O
than O
most O
nyc O
italian O
joints O
i've O
tried O
similar O
dishes B
at O
. O

the O
worst O
excuse O
for O
japanese O
food B
i've O
ever O
encountered O
. O

a O
million O
better O
places O
to O
go O
in O
the O
city O
. O

if O
celebrities O
make O
you O
sweat O
, O
then O
your O
in O
for O
a O
ride O
, O
but O
if O
your O
like O
most O
around O
these O
parts O
then O
you'll O
just O
yawn O
and O
wonder O
whats O
with O
all O
the O
hype O
. O

okay O
i O
don't O
mind O
the O
oily O
part O
cause O
most O
are O
cooked O
that O
way O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
bland O
. O

i O
ordered O
a O
chicken B
teriyaki O
dish B
and O
found O
that O
the O
chicken B
was O
extremely O
dry O
. O

i O
love O
it O
. O

if O
you O
want O
something O
really O
different O
than O
try O
jekyll O
and O
hyde O
. O

we O
had O
reservations B
at O
9pm O
, O
but O
was O
not O
seated O
until O
<number> O
15pm O
. O

we O
had O
pam's O
special B
fried B
fish B
and O
it O
was O
amazing O
. O

its O
located O
in O
greenewich O
village O
. O

there O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
such O
lousy O
service B
! O

three O
strikes O
and O
this O
restaurant O
is O
out O
. O

we O
bring O
in O
a O
party O
of O
ten O
or O
so O
every O
week O
. O

my O
boyfriend O
had O
the O
new O
england O
chowder O
it O
was O
good O
but O
i O
think O
the O
award O
should O
go O
to O
the O
lobster O
bisque O
. O

so O
, O
a O
little O
inconsistency O
there O
but O
either O
way O
, O
both O
pizzas B
were O
really O
good O
. O

overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
our O
other O
sushi B
favorites O
, O
but O
everything O
was O
delicious O
. O

we O
would O
return O
to O
this O
place O
again O
! O

not O
enough O
wines B
by B
the B
glass B
either O
. O

i O
had O
the O
duck B
breast B
special B
on O
my O
last O
visit O
and O
it O
was O
incredible O
. O

i O
must O
say O
it's O
a O
little O
pricey O
for O
the O
food B
because O
it O
was O
not O
as O
spectacular O
as O
the O
view O
. O

these O
innovators O
of O
french B
indian B
fusion B
do O
a O
great O
job O
of O
making O
dishes B
as O
interesting O
as O
possible O
while O
still O
being O
accessible O
. O

just O
don't O
take O
the O
seat B
between O
the O
bar B
and O
the O
back O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
, O
i O
saw O
a O
woman O
get O
nudged O
40times O
sitting O
there O
. O

no O
gimmicks O
here O
the O
food B
speaks O
for O
itself O
in O
its O
freshness O
and O
preparation O
. O

we O
were O
worried O
we O
would O
have O
trouble O
getting O
in O
, O
but O
somehow O
managed O
to O
have O
a O
short O
wait B
. O

my O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B
shrimp B
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

everything O
i O
had O
was O
good O
, O
and O
i'm O
a O
eater O
. O

one O
should O
not O
go O
to O
lucky O
strike O
for O
the O
food B
. O

the O
service B
is O
awful O
the O
last O
time O
i O
was O
there O
and O
i O
do O
mean O
the O
last O
time O
we O
were O
told O
that O
they O
needed O
our O
table B
so O
we O
would O
have O
to O
leave O
. O

we O
could O
only O
get O
through O
an O
appetizer B
and O
cheese B
fondue B
. O

to O
me O
it O
exemplifies O
soho O
, O
cute O
, O
artsy O
, O
interesting O
. O

try O
everything O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
it O
is O
all O
good O
. O

both O
times O
we O
waited O
well O
over O
a O
half O
hour O
for O
a O
table B
even O
though O
we O
had O
reservations B
. O

happy O
to O
be O
a O
regular O
at O
this O
place O
and O
would O
warmly O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
. O

i've O
been O
eating O
at O
taj O
mahal O
for O
over O
twenty O
years O
and O
have O
found O
them O
to O
be O
the O
most O
excellent O
of O
the O
indian O
eateries O
on O
this O
block O
of O
indian O
restaurants O
. O

night O
without O
a O
reservation B
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait B
at O
the O
bar B
for O
a O
little O
while O
, O
but O
the O
manager B
was O
so O
nice O
and O
made O
our O
wait B
a O
great O
experience O
. O

try O
the O
green B
curry B
! O
! O
! O

we O
had O
the O
scallops B
as O
an O
appetizer B
and O
they O
were O
delicious O
and O
the O
sauce B
was O
wonderful O
. O

we O
were O
also O
seated O
promptly O
at O
the O
time O
of O
our O
reservation B
and O
the O
service B
was O
very O
quick O
and O
professional O
. O

you O
rarely O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
seat B
and O
the O
currys B
masaman O
, O
green O
, O
red O
are O
full O
of O
flavor B
and O
come O
super O
spicy O
if O
you O
ask O
for O
it O
. O

the O
food B
there O
are O
sastifying O
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
to O
give O
this O
place O
a O
try O
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
visiting O
this O
restaurant O
and O
having O
dinner B
and O
drinks B
! O

the O
bar B
is O
very O
well O
stocked O
with O
interesting O
beers B
and O
well O
priced B
wines B
. O

i O
agree O
. O

last O
memorial O
day O
, O
i O
tried O
to O
make O
reservations B
but O
was O
told O
they O
were O
closed O
that O
weekend O
interesting O
, O
but O
. O
. O
. O
. O

the O
food B
was O
good O
. O

great O
wine B
selection B
, O
gigondas O
is O
worth O
the O
price B
, O
and O
the O
house B
champagne B
is O
a O
great O
value O
. O

at O
night O
, O
but O
it's O
hard O
to O
hear O
your O
own O
conversation O
with O
everyone O
else O
competing O
for O
that O
same O
luxury O
the O
music B
playing O
in O
the O
background O
is O
also O
voluminous O
. O

it O
just O
wasn't O
thai O
. O

i O
have O
enjoyed O
everything O
i O
have O
ever O
gotten O
and O
the O
fish B
is O
so O
fresh O
and O
always O
prepared O
in O
a O
great O
way O
. O

i O
particularly O
love O
their O
yellowfun B
tuna B
and O
their O
mussel B
selection B
. O

i O
love O
to O
visit O
murrays O
for O
my O
bagel B
fix O
. O

we O
made O
early O
dinner B
reservations B
and O
were O
thoroughly O
impressed O
, O
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
grandfather O
, O
its O
old O
school O
italian O
scenery B
with O
lots O
of O
fun O
stuff O
to O
admire O
. O

recommended O
. O

the O
place B
was O
nice O
and O
calm O
. O

cheese O
plate B
is O
a O
varied O
delight O
and O
great O
bargain O
at O
<number> O
. O

i O
could O
have O
drank O
<number> O
glasses B
of B
water B
and O
still O
been O
parched O
so O
watch O
out O
. O

when O
we O
sat O
, O
we O
got O
great O
and O
fast O
service B
. O

most O
of O
the O
servers B
are O
very O
attentive O
, O
friendly O
and O
quite O
attractive O
. O

i O
think O
locals O
rate O
this O
place O
so O
high O
. O

service O
is O
average O
. O

but O
they've O
done O
a O
really O
nice O
job O
of B
offering O
all O
the O
typical O
pizzeria O
faves O
plus O
some O
terrific O
specials B
like O
the O
godmother O
pizza B
a O
sort B
of B
traditional B
flat B
pizza B
with B
an B
olive B
oil O
brushed O
crust B
and B
less B
tomato B
sauce B
than B
usual O
. O

go O
girls O
! O
! O
! O

they O
forgot O
a O
sandwich B
, O
didn't O
include O
plastic B
forks B
, O
and O
didn't O
include O
pita B
with O
the O
hummus B
platter B
. O

the O
steak B
is O
good O
, O
the O
fish B
is O
good O
and O
the O
sushi B
was O
surprisingly O
great O
. O

for O
asian O
fusion O
, O
there O
are O
many O
places O
further O
downtown O
. O

old O
school O
meets O
new O
world O
. O

i O
am O
reluctant O
to O
write O
because O
i O
would O
not O
want O
my O
jem O
of O
a O
pizza B
place O
to O
become O
overcrowded O
. O

the O
service B
was O
poor O
, O
restaurant O
poorly O
lit O
, O
staff B
not O
very O
attentive O
and O
i O
would O
have O
rather O
eaten O
at O
a O
mcdonald's O
than O
this O
joint O
. O

this O
is O
probably O
one O
of O
my O
new O
favorite O
places O
. O

for O
being O
number O
<number> O
, O
this O
place O
has O
alot O
of O
work O
to O
do O
in O
order O
to O
truly O
earn O
its O
so O
called O
reputation O
. O

for O
myself O
and O
family O
we O
would O
only O
go O
here O
to O
celebrate O
an O
occassion O
, O
i O
do O
prefer O
smaller O
, O
quiter O
restaurants O
. O

the O
one O
on O
the O
east O
side O
is O
much O
better O
than O
the O
one O
on O
the O
west O
side O
. O

they O
all O
know O
you O
. O

my O
gf O
and O
i O
still O
choose O
to O
eat O
there O
a O
lot O
because O
of O
diverse O
cocktails B
, O
the O
chill O
decor B
, O
and O
the O
decent O
sushi B
. O

we O
ended O
the O
dinner B
with O
a O
surprisingly O
light O
and O
flaky O
apple B
tarte B
tatin B
. O

the O
buffet B
had O
a O
nice O
selection B
. O

waitstaff O
are O
very O
friendly O
. O

this O
restaurant O
is O
such O
a O
great O
place O
. O

once O
you O
step O
into O
cosette O
, O
you're O
miraculously O
in O
a O
small O
, O
off O
the O
beaten O
path O
parisian O
bistro O
. O

i've O
been O
several O
times O
and O
am O
totally O
smitten O
. O

terrible O
experience O
. O

i O
love O
the O
place O
. O

service O
was O
slow O
had O
to O
wait O
to O
order O
and O
get O
food B
although O
not O
crowded O
. O

will O
have O
to O
return O
to O
try O
the O
chocolate B
! O

it's O
only O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
for O
a O
regular O
slice O
and O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
for O
a O
slice O
with O
a O
mushroom O
, O
not O
mushrooms O
. O

there O
is O
a O
real O
gallery O
of O
stars O
that O
have O
visited O
. O

the O
food B
was O
below O
average O
, O
the O
service B
was O
pathetic O
, O
there O
was O
no O
ambience B
at O
all O
. O

i O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
shows O
put O
on O
by O
the O
actors O
. O

our O
first O
time O
in O
new O
york O
and O
we O
had O
to O
try O
a O
new O
york O
bagel O
. O

service B
was O
efficient O
courteous O
. O

this O
one O
is O
definintely O
my O
least O
favorite O
. O

i O
have O
been O
urged O
by O
friends O
for O
months O
to O
check O
out O
the O
mermaid O
inn O
. O

the O
miso B
soup B
lacked O
flavor B
and O
the O
fish B
was O
unfortunately O
not O
as O
well O
prepared O
as O
in O
the O
past O
. O

everytime O
my O
husband O
and O
i O
go O
there O
, O
we O
are O
never O
disappointed O
. O

they O
are O
the O
best O
bagels B
i've O
had O
. O

we O
were O
not O
disappointed O
. O

i've O
read O
some O
of O
the O
previews O
reviews O
people O
are O
either O
not O
new O
yorkers O
or O
have O
more O
appreciation O
for O
ambience B
then O
food B
. O

toons O
has O
recently O
been O
redone O
, O
so O
it's O
now O
a O
very O
attractive O
space B
. O

<number> O
for O
<number> O
filets B
, O
<number> O
sides B
, O
an O
appetizer B
and O
drinks B
. O

while O
the O
prices B
are O
nothing O
special O
, O
the O
portions B
are O
huge O
. O

its O
a O
nice O
quiet O
location B
to O
go O
eat O
a O
good O
meal B
, O
relax O
, O
be O
able O
to O
talk O
and O
have O
a O
very O
good O
time O
. O

we O
arrived O
for O
dinner B
expecting O
to O
be O
impressed O
by O
a O
place O
that O
has O
an O
impressive O
past O
but O
, O
that's O
just O
it O
the O
past O
! O

however O
, O
i O
think O
this O
place O
is O
a O
good O
hang O
out O
spot B
. O

the O
menu B
is O
prix O
fixe O
, O
so O
be O
prepared O
to O
spend O
at O
least O
<number> O
per O
person O
, O
but O
it O
is O
well O
worth O
itsuperb O
food B
. O

rao O
is O
a O
good O
restaurant O
, O
but O
it's O
nothing O
special O
. O

the O
wine B
list B
is O
extensive O
and O
impressive O
. O

we O
had O
the O
most O
wonderful O
waitress B
. O

while O
the O
staff B
at O
this O
little O
bistro O
is O
very O
friendly O
, O
i O
have O
never O
experienced O
more O
incompetency O
. O

the O
quail B
was O
fantastic O
and O
unique O
and O
the O
pastas B
were O
full O
of O
flavor B
. O

when O
we O
left O
at O
<number> O
<number> O
pm O
, O
it O
was O
packed O
and O
noisy O
. O

okay O
, O
so O
i O
never O
write O
but O
there O
doesn't O
seem O
to O
fair O
balance O
of O
positive O
to O
negative O
reviews O
concerning O
green O
bo O
and O
it's O
time O
to O
speak O
up O
i O
live O
in O
chinatown O
. O

the O
zucchini B
and O
mashed B
potatoes B
are O
a O
blend O
of O
garlic B
and O
butter B
which O
simply O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth O
. O

the O
staff B
is O
courteous O
and O
friendly O
. O

never O
fails O
to O
please O
. O

decor O
is O
nice O
though O
service B
can O
be O
spotty O
. O

aside O
from O
the O
rushed O
service B
, O
we O
were O
very O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B
and O
the O
drinks B
. O

will O
absolutely O
visit O
again O
. O

make O
sure O
you O
have O
the O
spicy O
scallop O
roll B
. O
. O
. O

i O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
anyone O
who O
is O
looking O
for O
a O
fine O
indian O
dining B
experience B
that O
is O
definitely O
a O
value O
for O
your O
dollar O
. O

and O
even O
with O
it's O
pub O
atmosphere B
they O
were O
great O
to O
my O
kids O
too O
! O

this O
big O
draw O
is O
the O
all O
you O
can O
sushi B
here O
for O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
! O

i O
consider O
the O
best O
grand O
sichuan O
restaurant O
in O
nyc O
. O

we O
spent O
<number> O
definetly O
will O
come O
back O
with O
my O
friends O
! O
! O
! O

went O
to O
village O
last O
night O
for O
my O
birthday O
. O

some O
of O
the O
workers B
ignore O
me O
and O
talk O
to O
the O
female O
customers O
, O
other O
times O
, O
they've O
skipped O
my O
order B
. O

the O
specials B
are O
usually O
quite O
good O
too O
. O

they've O
the O
best O
desserts B
and O
mixed B
drinks B
as O
well O
as O
snack B
foods B
. O

try O
the O
chocolate B
mud B
cake B
warmed O
with O
<number> O
scoops O
of O
dulce B
de B
leche B
gelato B
. O

that's O
good O
and O
bad O
. O

really O
cool O
stauff B
inside O
. O

while O
the O
new O
restaurant O
still O
features O
much O
of O
the O
same O
classical B
furniture B
that O
made O
tiffin O
so O
attractive O
, O
the O
menu B
has O
been O
overhauled O
. O

the O
best O
burger B
i O
have O
had O
in O
the O
village O
. O

we O
visited O
orsay O
during O
ny O
restaurant O
week O
and O
tried O
their O
<number> O
menu B
. O

i O
would O
have O
gotten O
some O
cole B
slaw B
and O
a O
knish B
if O
my O
stomach O
had O
more O
space O
. O

came O
here O
for O
restaurant O
week O
, O
didn't O
save O
much O
, O
but O
it O
was O
still O
great O
. O

would O
never O
go O
back O
there O
. O

three O
of O
us O
arrived O
for O
dinner B
about O
<number> O
<number> O
on O
a O
week O
night O
without O
reservations B
. O

the O
blond B
wood B
decor B
is O
very O
soothing O
, O
the O
premium O
sake B
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
service B
is O
great O
. O

there O
is O
usually O
a O
wait B
but O
it O
is O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

be O
careful O
, O
when O
they O
say O
spicy O
, O
they O
mean O
it O
! O

your O
money B
could O
easily O
be O
better O
spent O
elsewhere O
anywhere O
. O

only O
drawback O
they O
won't O
toast O
your O
bagel B
, O
and O
they O
don't O
make O
eggs B
for O
the O
bagel B
. O

as O
always O
we O
had O
a O
great O
glass B
of B
wine B
while O
we O
waited O
. O

bring O
your O
appetites O
. O

the O
wait B
staff B
is O
pleasant O
, O
fun O
, O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
gorgeous O
in O
the O
wonderful O
aesthetic O
beautification O
way O
, O
not O
in O
that O
she's O
way O
cuter O
than O
me O
that O
b O
way O
. O

of O
course O
this O
atmosphere B
is O
lacking O
, O
but O
what O
do O
you O
expect O
from O
a O
<number> O
hour O
bagel B
place O
anyways O
? O

service O
was O
very O
good O
and O
warm O
. O

for O
dinner B
i O
had O
the O
chicken B
tikka O
masala O
and O
some O
garlic B
naan B
. O

cornelia O
street O
looks O
like O
a O
broadway O
set O
for O
west O
side O
story O
and O
the O
inside O
of O
po O
is O
so O
cool O
quaint O
you O
really O
can't O
top O
the O
setting B
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner B
in O
nyc O
. O

like O
others O
have O
said O
, O
don't O
expect O
the O
restaurant O
to O
make O
a O
nite O
out O
romantic O
for O
you O
and O
yes O
, O
a O
busy O
restaurant O
may O
require O
you O
to O
wait O
. O

seriously O
, O
this O
place O
kicks O
ass O
. O

food O
was O
good O
and O
the O
view B
of O
the O
new O
york O
city O
skiline O
was O
terrific O
even O
on O
a O
foggy O
rainy O
day O
like O
that O
of O
when O
i O
went O
. O

also O
, O
because O
it O
is O
so O
thin O
, O
it O
gets O
cold O
very O
quickly O
and O
its O
not O
that O
filling O
. O

the O
food B
is O
nothing O
like O
its O
menu B
description B
. O

try O
the O
pad O
se O
ew O
or O
chicken O
with B
cashew O
nuts O
for O
a O
memorable O
and O
repeatable O
experience O
. O

it's O
just O
o O
. O
k O
. O
pizza B
. O

i O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
highly O
recommend O
. O

i've O
been O
here O
twice O
now O
. O

the O
food B
is O
decent O
at O
best O
, O
and O
the O
ambience B
, O
well O
, O
it's O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion O
, O
some O
may O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
thing O
, O
i O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying O
. O

the O
best O
place O
to O
bring O
kids O
or O
any O
friends O
who O
want O
to O
do O
something O
different O
. O

the O
service B
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
, O
but O
they O
were O
very O
friendly O
. O

however O
, O
i O
do O
not O
understand O
the O
extraordinary O
hype O
about O
this O
restaurant O
. O

it's O
a O
small O
cute O
restaurant O
. O

i O
will O
be O
returning O
. O

leon O
is O
an O
east O
village O
gem O
casual O
but O
hip O
, O
with O
well O
prepared O
basic O
french O
bistro B
fare B
, O
good O
specials B
, O
a O
warm O
and O
lively O
atmosphere B
. O

the O
food B
is O
above O
average O
for O
midtown O
and O
sligtly O
better O
than O
some O
of O
the O
other O
heartland O
breweries O
in O
the O
city O
. O

thius O
is O
a O
must O
for O
anyone O
who O
loves O
shabu O
shabu O
. O

the O
food B
was O
absolutely O
horrible O
! O

food O
doesn't O
appear O
to O
be O
cooked O
on O
premisis O
but O
there's O
a O
high O
turnover O
so O
its O
pretty O
fresh O
. O

restaurant O
was O
dirty O
and O
unkempt O
. O

nice O
place O
though O
. O

warning O
you O
may O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
dine O
at O
other O
japanese O
restaurants O
after O
a O
visit O
to O
mizu O
! O

similar O
to O
other O
indian O
restaurants O
, O
they O
use O
the O
dinner B
special B
to O
attract O
customers O
at O
the O
door O
. O

it O
is O
a O
small O
restuarant O
so O
go O
early O
and O
it O
will O
be O
nice O
and O
quiet O
go O
late O
and O
it O
will O
be O
packed O
! O

the O
people B
with B
carts B
of B
food B
don't O
understand O
you O
because O
they O
don't O
speak O
english O
, O
their O
job O
is O
to O
give O
you O
the O
delicious O
food B
you O
point O
at O
. O

the O
crackling B
calamari B
salad B
, O
which O
is O
usually O
a O
cheap O
disaster O
at O
many O
restaurants O
, O
is O
crispy O
and O
lightly O
dressed O
. O

not O
the O
greatest O
sushi B
place B
, O
but O
excellent O
for O
a O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
all O
you O
can O
eat O
. O

shockingly O
easy O
to O
throw O
a O
group B
dinner B
here O
simple O
contract O
, O
deposit O
only O
to O
hold O
the O
date O
the O
entire O
2nd O
fl O
mezz O
for O
our O
grp O
of O
<number> O
. O

the O
thai O
ice B
tea B
was O
amazingly O
smooth O
and O
yummy O
! O

we've O
never O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
the O
staff B
but O
maybe O
we've O
been O
lucky O
? O

drinks O
way O
over O
priced B
. O

the O
main O
downside O
to O
the O
place O
is O
the O
nazi O
like O
guy B
running O
it O
who O
constantly O
complains O
about O
the O
noise B
level B
. O

what O
i O
didn't O
like O
was O
how O
the O
food B
came O
right O
after O
it O
was O
ordered O
. O

but O
warning O
to O
all O
those O
that O
use O
this O
site O
be O
weary O
, O
be O
very O
weary O
of O
recommendations O
. O

moderate O
prices B
. O

we O
had O
a O
great O
time O
at O
the O
jekyll O
and O
hyde O
pub O
last O
night O
. O

try O
it O
side O
by O
side O
and O
there's O
no O
comparison O
. O

i O
think O
i've O
had O
some O
the O
best O
meals B
of O
my O
life O
at O
minnow O
. O

my O
biggest O
complaint O
was O
the O
un O
tasty O
food B
although O
presented O
well O
. O

this O
tiny O
restaurant O
is O
as O
cozy O
as O
it O
gets O
, O
with O
that O
certain O
parisian O
flair O
. O

so O
sorry O
i O
can't O
rate O
this O
better O
. O

most O
importantly O
, O
food B
is O
excellent O
. O

buon O
appetito O
! O

great O
roofdeck B
, O
nice O
group O
of O
<number> O
somethings O
, O
but O
no O
music B
, O
kind O
of O
quiet O
. O

if O
we O
were O
to O
move O
from O
the O
upper O
east O
side O
, O
we O
would O
genuinely O
miss O
this O
restaurant O
. O

the O
best O
part O
of O
the O
experience O
was O
knowing O
that O
the O
manager B
a O
bubbly O
, O
friendly O
young O
woman O
with O
a O
great O
smile O
truly O
cared O
about O
how O
we O
were O
doing O
. O

ok O
, O
for O
all O
of O
us O
growing O
up O
in O
the O
village O
of O
nyc O
, O
we O
have O
spoiled O
by O
a O
plethora O
of O
restaurants O
, O
most O
of O
which O
stay O
open O
very O
late O
. O

however O
, O
service B
was O
as O
plain O
as O
sesame B
crusted B
salmon O
i O
had O
. O

i O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

it's O
great O
to O
go O
for O
a O
quick O
lunch B
either O
alone O
or O
with O
a O
friend O
. O

the O
food B
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
but O
it O
was O
the O
horrible O
service B
that O
made O
me O
vow O
never O
to O
go O
back O
. O

lloovve O
this O
place O
. O

so O
some O
of O
the O
reviews O
here O
are O
accurate O
about O
the O
crowd B
and O
noise B
. O

you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
and O
with O
that O
logic O
in O
mind O
, O
spice O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
grab O
some O
cheap O
eats B
and O
drinks B
in O
a O
beautiful O
setting B
. O

finally O
, O
after O
all O
the O
raving O
i O
went O
to O
check O
it O
out O
with O
one O
of O
my O
enthusiastic O
friends O
this O
last O
saturday O
night O
and O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
its O
all O
its O
cracked O
up O
to O
be O
. O

place O
should O
also O
have O
a O
<number> O
, O
<number> O
, O
<number> O
chili O
rating O
to O
be O
more O
authentic O
. O
. O
. O

the O
service B
was O
terrible O
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served B
. O

went O
last O
thursday O
. O

i O
love O
this O
place O
more O
and O
more O
everytime O
i O
go O
. O

i O
go O
and O
eat O
out O
at O
many O
different O
restaurants O
and O
this O
is O
one O
place O
you O
have O
go O
and O
try O
. O

other O
than O
being O
a O
little O
crowded O
and O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
, O
the O
atmosphere B
is O
filled O
with O
energy O
and O
the O
beautiful O
people B
of O
course O
and O
the O
food B
was O
surprising O
good O
! O

we O
only O
ordered O
desserts B
and O
drinks B
, O
but O
no O
refills O
were O
offered O
. O

saul O
is O
the O
best O
restaurant O
on O
smith O
street O
and O
in O
brooklyn O
. O

waiters O
are O
slow O
but O
sweet O
. O

i O
have O
been O
here O
a O
few O
times O
for O
dinner B
, O
once O
for O
brunch B
and O
twice O
for O
lunch B
. O

we O
went O
to O
ino O
for O
valentines O
. O

the O
real O
kicker O
of O
the O
menu B
, O
however O
, O
is O
the O
beef B
cubes B
or O
the O
chicken B
with B
chili B
and B
lemon B
grass B
. O

it O
was O
good O
, O
but O
was O
not O
what O
i O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
. O

the O
music B
is O
the O
best O
among O
all O
the O
indian O
restaurants O
i O
have O
visited O
. O

the O
bread B
and O
lamb B
chops B
i O
had O
before O
the O
meal B
were O
quite O
good O
, O
however O
. O

he O
always O
says O
, O
i O
don't O
have O
customers O
. O

rao's O
has O
the O
best O
service B
and O
atmosphere B
in O
nyc O
. O

instead O
ordered O
an O
ice O
cold O
beer B
which O
to O
me O
works O
with O
indian O
. O

good O
for O
dates O
or O
with O
friends O
. O

they O
never O
brought O
us O
complimentary O
noodles B
, O
ignored O
repeated O
requests O
for O
sugar B
, O
and O
threw O
our O
dishes B
on O
the O
table O
. O

one O
of O
the O
best O
chicken O
tikka O
masala O
. O

excellent O
dumplings B
served O
amid O
clean O
, O
chic O
decor B
. O

the O
kitchen B
however O
, O
is O
almost O
always O
slow O
. O

the O
corned B
beef B
and O
pastrami B
are O
excellent O
, O
much O
less O
fatty O
than O
those O
big O
tourist O
places O
around O
times O
square O
. O

cute O
place B
, O
nice O
wait B
staff B
but O
would O
never O
go O
there O
again O
. O

we O
had O
a O
good O
time O
. O

also O
, O
the O
hostess B
called O
me O
today O
to O
thank O
us O
for O
coming O
and O
mentioned O
how O
she O
hoped O
that O
my O
girlfriend O
enjoyed O
her O
birthday O
unexpected O
, O
but O
a O
truly O
above O
and O
beyond O
thing O
to O
do O
. O
. O
. O

people B
are O
rude O
bit O
again O
it's O
new O
york O
! O

we O
all O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

the O
plain B
slice B
is O
great O
and O
if O
you O
get O
toppings B
, O
the O
whole O
slice B
is O
topped O
with O
them O
, O
not O
sparsely O
sprinkled O
on O
like O
some O
places O
. O

service O
was O
also O
horrible O
and O
the O
ambience B
is O
not O
that O
great O
. O

service O
is O
great O
, O
takeout B
is O
good O
too O
. O

based O
on O
the O
reviews O
on O
here O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
restaurant O
is O
overwhelmed O
after O
the O
<number> O
pm O
. O

the O
pizza B
is O
overpriced O
and O
soggy O
. O

everything O
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
menu B
is O
quite O
extensive O
, O
and O
you O
eat O
with O
a O
view B
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
city O
. O

you'll O
pay O
at O
least O
double O
at O
any O
other O
italian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
, O
and O
most O
still O
don't O
compare O
. O

for O
the O
quality B
of B
food B
, O
a O
little O
too O
expensive O
. O

came O
looking O
for O
this O
place O
because O
i O
heard O
good O
things O
. O

i O
live O
on O
the O
street O
this O
place O
is O
on O
. O

horrible O
. O

here's O
to O
the O
fake O
fish B
tanks B
too O
. O
. O
. O

its O
worth O
the O
wait B
though O
. O

i've O
never O
had O
bad O
service B
and O
the O
fish B
is O
fresh O
and O
delicious O
. O

the O
first O
time O
i O
went O
, O
and O
was O
completely O
taken O
by O
the O
live B
jazz B
band B
and O
atmosphere B
, O
i O
ordered O
the O
lobster O
cobb O
salad O
. O

we O
decided O
to O
eat O
in O
tea B
room B
which O
was O
small O
and O
cute O
. O

what O
an O
amazing O
meal B
and O
experience O
! O

unique O
apppetizers B
. O

the O
staff B
has O
always O
been O
attentive O
and O
kind O
, O
and O
i've O
always O
been O
amazed O
at O
how O
they've O
handled O
all O
the O
various O
different O
group O
sizes O
that O
come O
in O
. O

it O
is O
the O
best O
deal O
in O
town O
for O
a O
monday O
night O
dinner B
at O
a O
fine O
restaurant O
. O

nothing O
special O
about O
this O
place O
. O

also O
, O
the O
sandwiches B
nearing O
<number> O
didn't O
come O
with O
anything O
like O
chips B
or O
a O
side B
. O

and O
never O
strayed O
. O

the O
wait B
here O
is O
long O
for O
dim B
sum B
, O
but O
if O
you O
don't O
like O
sharing O
tables B
or O
if O
the O
typical O
raucous O
dim B
sum B
atmosphere B
is O
not O
your O
gig O
, O
this O
is O
a O
sleek O
for O
chinatown O
alternative O
. O

leave O
the O
kids O
at O
home O
! O

this O
place O
has O
good O
potential O
, O
but O
needs O
a O
significant O
amount O
of O
work O
before O
we O
can O
justify O
spending O
that O
much O
money B
on O
indian B
food B
you O
can O
get O
everywhere O
else O
. O

everything O
is O
always O
cooked O
to O
perfection O
, O
the O
service B
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
decor B
cool O
and O
understated O
. O

and O
all O
of O
that O
won't O
break O
your O
bank O
! O

the O
thai O
food B
is O
good O
. O

just O
moved O
to O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
we've O
been O
trying O
all O
the O
west O
village O
sushi O
restaurants O
. O

great O
selection B
of B
wine B
, O
and O
seafood B
. O

delicious O
. O

acceptable O
prices B
. O

big O
thumbs O
up O
! O

we O
were O
seated O
at O
the O
sushi B
bar B
in O
front O
of O
yasuda O
. O

we O
have O
lived O
in O
chelsea O
for O
two O
years O
and O
have O
never O
noticed O
this O
restaurant O
. O

as O
i O
made O
the O
title O
, O
it's O
an O
affordable O
restaurant O
for O
great O
taste B
. O

they O
even O
scoop O
it O
out O
nice O
for O
those O
on O
a O
diet O
not O
too O
much O
not O
to O
little O
. O

definitely O
not O
worth O
the O
price B
! O

orsay O
, O
is O
a O
very O
pleasnt O
throw O
back O
to O
traditional O
french O
food B
, O
and O
french O
service B
as O
well O
. O

it's O
easy O
to O
get O
a O
table B
for O
a O
large O
group O
and O
you O
don't O
get O
hustled O
out O
. O

great O
food B
at O
reasonable O
prices B
. O

salads O
are O
a O
delicious O
way O
to O
begin O
the O
meal B
. O

i O
ordered O
tamarind B
duck B
and O
my O
wife O
ordered O
noodles B
with B
ground B
beef B
, O
and O
we O
were O
both O
delighted O
by O
the O
way O
the O
dishes B
evoked O
thai O
flavors B
in O
unexpected O
ways O
. O

that's O
why O
you O
have O
to O
pay O
more O
for O
that O
. O

if O
you've O
ever O
been O
along O
the O
river O
in O
weehawken O
you O
have O
an O
idea O
of O
the O
top O
of O
view B
the O
chart O
house O
has O
to O
offer O
. O

i O
loved O
it O
. O

they're O
are O
better O
taiwanese O
restaurants O
and O
they O
are O
located O
in O
flushing O
, O
queens O
. O

the O
prices B
are O
about O
<number> O
for O
an O
entree B
for O
dinner B
and O
even O
less O
for O
lunch B
. O

and O
you O
can't O
beat O
the O
prices B
. O

but O
i O
wouldn't O
wanna O
live O
there O
. O

arigato O
gozimas O
yuka O
! O

should O
you O
happen O
to O
be O
impressed O
by O
the O
cuisine B
definitely O
try O
it O
. O

i O
had O
the O
black B
cod B
with B
yuzu B
sauce B
, O
which O
was O
wonderful O
. O

prices O
too O
high O
for O
this O
cramped O
and O
unappealing O
resturant O
. O

tuk O
tuk O
is O
one O
of O
the O
rare O
choices O
for O
me O
to O
go O
in O
brooklyn O
. O

this O
quiet O
dark O
asian O
bistro O
is O
well O
worth O
the O
trip O
. O

i O
knew O
upon O
visiting O
nyc O
that O
i O
wanted O
to O
try O
an O
orginal O
deli O
. O

i O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place O
! O

total O
hipster O
wannabe O
attitude O
in O
an O
otherwise O
sweet O
spot B
. O

yes O
, O
there O
might O
be O
a O
wait B
if O
you O
have O
no O
reservations B
. O

thank O
you O
emilio O
. O

first O
of O
all O
dal O
bukhara O
rocks O
. O

everything O
, O
from O
the O
soft O
bread B
, O
soggy O
salad B
, O
and O
<number> O
minute O
wait B
time O
, O
with O
an O
incredibly O
rude O
service B
to O
deliver O
below O
average O
food B
. O

i O
asked O
for O
them O
spicy O
and O
they O
were O
delicious O
. O

it O
is O
terrific O
, O
as O
is O
the O
value O
. O

the O
sicilian B
is O
my O
favorite O
it O
is O
moist O
not O
dry O
like O
most O
places O
but O
all O
their O
pizza B
is O
great O
! O

downstairs O
lounge B
is O
always O
a O
good O
attraction O

the O
menu B
prices B
are O
a O
bit O
expensive O
for O
what O
you O
get O
in O
quality B
and O
portion B
size B
. O

the O
food B
was O
amazing O
, O
and O
the O
service B
was O
prompt O
and O
helpful O
, O
but O
not O
over O
bearing O
or O
rushed O
. O

food B
was O
delivered O
by O
a O
busboy B
, O
not O
waiter B
we O
got O
no O
cheese B
offered O
for O
the O
pasta B
, O
our O
water B
and B
wine B
glasses B
remained O
empty O
our O
entire O
meal B
, O
when O
we O
would O
have O
easily O
spent O
another O
<number> O
on O
wine B
. O

the O
takeout B
is O
great O
too O
since O
they O
give O
high O
quality O
tupperware O
as O
well O
. O

the O
food B
was O
not O
fresh O
, O
the O
sauces B
were O
bland O
and O
very O
oily O
. O

off O
the O
beaten O
path O
, O
this O
jewel O
of O
a O
restaurant O
shines O
just O
one O
block O
away O
from O
the O
plethora O
of O
6th O
street O
indian O
restaurants O
. O

could O
be O
pricey O
without O
a O
prix B
fixe B
meal B
. O

this O
is O
definitely O
an O
excellent O
date O
spot B
because O
of O
the O
ambiance B
and O
on O
the O
weekends O
the O
night B
scene B
is O
more O
than O
alive O
. O

i O
would O
defiantly O
come O
back O
here O
again O
as O
one O
of O
my O
top O
choices O
. O

one O
of O
us O
actually O
liked O
the O
expresso B
that's O
it O
. O

everyone O
was O
more O
then O
happy O
with O
his O
choices O
. O

again O
, O
the O
waitress B
was O
awesome O
. O

worth O
the O
trip O
from O
manhattan O
. O

i O
loved O
everythig O
about O
it O
especially O
the O
shows B
and O
actors B
. O

the O
service B
was O
fast O
and O
friendly O
and O
the O
food B
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
they O
had O
the O
best O
hot B
sauce B
to O
add O
to O
your O
meals B
. O

the O
food B
was O
just O
ok O
, O
i O
would O
never O
go O
back O
. O

zero O
ambiance B
to O
boot O
. O

got O
a O
little O
loud O
after O
8pm O
when O
the O
joint O
got O
full O
. O

scalina O
fedeli O
reminded O
me O
why O
service B
is O
so O
integral O
to O
fine O
dining B
. O

i O
recommend O
the O
thai B
popcorn B

i O
can't O
wait O
for O
the O
nex O
time O
. O

everything O
looks O
great O
, O
the O
drinks B
, O
the O
decor B
, O
the O
food B
, O
even O
the O
people O
. O

as O
soon O
as O
my O
father O
lifted O
his O
pen O
from O
the O
check B
a O
chef B
appeared O
to O
usher O
us O
out O
. O

the O
parathas B
and O
kebabs B
are O
made O
when O
ordered O
ensuring O
a O
level O
of O
freshness O
that O
is O
unsurpassed O
. O

great O
neighborhood O
joint O
. O

the O
tuna B
and O
wasabe B
potatoes B
are O
excellent O
. O

the O
only O
disappointment O
was O
the O
coat B
check B
girls B
who O
didn't O
seem O
to O
know O
what O
a O
customer O
is O
on O
a O
realtively O
non O
busy O
night O
for O
the O
coat B
check B
girls B
. O

my O
fiance O
took O
me O
to O
scopa O
last O
week O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
i O
couldn't O
believe O
the O
food B
. O

ummm O
. O
. O
. O
the O
beer B
was O
cold O
. O

i O
take O
all O
my O
nyc O
guests O
to O
vt's O
. O

it O
is O
sometimes O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
and O
can O
get O
a O
little O
warm O
, O
but O
hello O
, O
it's O
nyc O
! O

we O
had O
great O
desserts B
including O
the O
best O
cannoli B
i've O
ever O
had O
and O
then O
they O
offered O
an O
after B
dinner B
drink B
, O
on O
the O
house O
. O

good O
crowd O
, O
good O
outdoor B
seating B
, O
with O
a O
hip O
japanese O
vibe B
. O

even O
with O
the O
prix B
fixe B
pricing B
, O
this O
restaurant O
is O
not O
worth O
it O
. O

we O
asked O
to O
be O
moved O
which O
took O
half O
an O
hour O
, O
and O
then O
were O
seated O
in O
a O
high O
traffic O
area B
in O
the O
back O
, O
even O
though O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
room B
was O
practically O
empty O
. O

good O
to O
find O
a O
restaurant O
where O
the O
owners B
have O
some O
imagination O
and O
they O
have O
actually O
pulled O
it O
off O
, O
like O
in O
this O
case O
. O

however O
, O
their O
popularity O
has O
yet O
to O
slow O
down O
, O
and O
i O
still O
find O
myself O
drawn O
to O
their O
ambiance B
and O
delectable O
reputation O
. O

where O
tanks B
in O
other O
chinatown O
restaurants O
display O
a O
lurking O
myriad O
of O
sad O
looking O
marine O
life O
in O
their O
murky O
waters O
, O
the O
tanks B
at O
ping's O
are O
clear O
as O
glass O
with O
healthy O
looking O
creatures O
who O
do O
not O
yet O
know O
that O
they O
will O
be O
part O
of O
some O
dim B
sum B
lover's O
brunch B
. O

the O
halibut O
was O
too O
salty O
, O
dessert B
was O
so O
so O
don't O
waste O
any O
of O
your O
calories O
and O
service B
was O
poor O
. O

the O
view B
is O
spectacular O
, O
and O
the O
food B
is O
great O
. O

the O
place B
wasn't O
too O
hard O
to O
find O
, O
but O
it O
was O
kind O
of O
packed O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
my O
boyfriend O
and O
i O
got O
our O
food B
, O
the O
line O
reached O
the O
door O
. O

good O
bagels B
and O
good O
cream B
cheese B
. O

the O
food B
is O
wonderful O
, O
tasty O
and O
filling O
, O
and O
the O
service B
is O
professional O
and O
friendly O
. O

it O
is O
also O
extremely O
well O
priced B
. O

always O
great O
service B
! O

i O
am O
happy O
i O
did O
the O
food B
was O
awsome O
. O

i O
have O
been O
in O
many O
restaurants O
all O
over O
the O
city O
and O
roth's O
steakhouse O
has O
quickly O
become O
one O
of O
my O
favorites O
. O

we O
ordered O
the O
chicken B
casserole B
, O
but O
what O
we O
got O
were O
a O
few O
small O
pieces O
of O
chicken B
, O
all O
dark O
meat B
and O
on O
the O
bone O
. O

a O
bit O
breezy O
up O
there O
on O
the O
mezzanine B
from O
the O
wind O
coming O
from O
the O
tracks O
. O

i O
went O
to O
df O
for O
valentines O
day O
dinner B
. O

i O
recommend O
the O
jelly B
fish B
, O
drunken B
chicken B
and O
the O
soupy B
dumplings B
, O
certainly O
the O
stir B
fry B
blue B
crab B
. O

i O
loved O
the O
shows O
. O

and O
i O
have O
been O
around O
the O
block O
, O
to O
say O
the O
very O
least O
. O

we O
could O
have O
made O
a O
meal B
of O
the O
yummy O
dumplings B
from O
the O
dumpling B
menu B
. O

the O
aesthetics B
of O
this O
place B
are O
like O
an O
airport O
lounge O
. O

then O
, O
get O
ripped O
on O
free O
box B
wine B
. O

my O
wife O
and O
i O
ate O
here O
earlier O
this O
week O
and O
have O
not O
stopped O
ranting O
and O
raving O
about O
the O
food B
. O

if O
you O
don't O
mind O
pre O
sliced O
low O
quality O
fish B
, O
unfriendly O
staff B
and O
a O
sushi B
chef B
that O
looks O
like O
he O
is O
miserable O
then O
this O
is O
your O
place O
. O

the O
food B
itself O
was O
just O
ok O
nothing O
spectacular O
but O
the O
service B
was O
awful O
. O

the O
pizza B
is O
yummy O
and O
i O
like O
the O
atmoshpere B
. O

as O
there O
were O
so O
many O
to O
choose O
from O
we O
wandered O
up O
and O
down O
the O
street O
looking O
in O
the O
windows O
and O
such O
noticicing O
many O
empty O
seats B
, O
except O
at O
taj O
mahal O
. O

also O
, O
don't O
plan O
on O
asking O
for O
your O
favorite O
roll B
, O
if O
it's O
not O
on O
the O
menu B
, O
you O
can't O
have O
it O
. O

give O
it O
a O
try O
and O
enjoy O
. O

good O
food B
. O

. O
. O
. O
and O
that's O
saying O
a O
lot O
. O

those O
rolls B
were O
big O
, O
but O
not O
good O
and O
sashimi B
wasn't O
fresh O
. O

the O
pesto B
pizza B
was O
excellent O
, O
thin O
crust O
pizza B
with O
a O
nice O
amount O
of O
spicy O
italian O
cheese B
that O
i'd O
never O
heard O
of O
before O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
could O
get O
attention O
from O
was O
one O
of O
at O
least O
two O
cats O
running O
around O
that O
kept O
batting O
at O
my O
table O
. O

if O
your O
into O
thai O
. O
. O
you O
cannot O
miss O
this O
great O
restaurant O
. O

going O
to O
ballato's O
is O
like O
coming O
home O
and O
eating O
in O
my O
own O
kitchen O
, O
an O
absolute O
delight O
! O

try O
the O
spicy O
shrimp B
appetizer B
again O
, O
not O
the O
greatest O
value O
in O
the O
world O
but O
worth O
the O
price B
and O
the O
lamb B
vindaloo B
is O
great O
. O

however O
, O
go O
for O
the O
ambience B
, O
and O
consider O
the O
food B
just O
a O
companion O
for O
a O
trip O
across O
the O
world O
! O

i O
think O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
more O
underrated O
places O
in O
the O
city O
. O

for O
out O
of O
towners O
who O
will O
get O
a O
big O
thrill O
out O
of O
the O
location O
! O

everyone O
that O
has O
ever O
come O
here O
with O
me O
has O
become O
a O
convert O
and O
returned O
regularly O
with O
their O
own O
friends O
. O

food O
was O
good O
not O
great O
not O
worth O
the O
wait B
or O
another O
visit O

i O
go O
at O
least O
<number> O
times O
a O
month O
and O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

obviously O
the O
chinese O
translation O
of O
this O
place O
does O
not O
mean O
big O
wong O
, O
it O
actually O
means O
great O
prosperity O
. O

i O
think O
the O
restaurant O
was O
too O
loud O
when O
full O
to O
be O
romantic O
. O

i O
have O
had O
so O
many O
dinners B
here O
and O
it's O
always O
been O
perfect O
on O
a O
date O
with O
my O
husband O
, O
with O
my O
mom O
, O
with O
girlfriends O
and O
larger O
groups O
. O

when O
you O
want O
a O
piece O
of O
beef B
, O
head O
on O
over O
. O

delicate O
spices B
, O
onions B
, O
eggs B
and O
a O
kick O
ass O
roti B
. O

incredible O
food B
at O
a O
very O
agreable O
price B
brings O
me O
back O
just O
about O
every O
other O
day O
to O
this O
authentic O
thai O
restaurant O
. O

i O
actually O
gave O
patroon O
another O
chance O
before O
writing O
this O
, O
but O
the O
second O
visit O
was O
even O
worse O
. O

also O
, O
if O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
sit O
at O
a O
certain O
table B
, O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
! O

unbelievable O
. O

a O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
really O
hits O
the O
spot O
on O
a O
sunday O
morning O
! O

i've O
been O
living O
in O
the O
columbia O
university O
area O
for O
about O
<number> O
years O
with O
<number> O
kids O
now O
in O
their O
teens O
. O

the O
menu B
has O
lots O
of O
options O
i O
hope O
to O
go O
back O
to O
try O
those O
potato B
pancakes B
. O

as O
soon O
as O
i O
wake O
up O
on O
a O
saturday O
or O
sunday O
it O
is O
the O
first O
thing O
on O
my O
mind O
is O
when O
and O
how O
i O
will O
be O
getting O
to O
fried B
dumpling B
. O

the O
staff B
isn't O
the O
friendliest O
or O
most O
competent O
, O
and O
i O
am O
stickler O
for O
service B
, O
but O
everything O
else O
about O
this O
place O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

my O
wife O
and O
i O
will O
usually O
only O
order O
one O
primi B
and O
one O
secondi B
and O
split O
them O
, O
as O
they O
tend O
to O
offer O
large O
portions B
. O

this O
restaurant O
was O
way O
overhyped O
. O

i've O
overheard O
comments O
from O
him O
to O
his O
employees B
that O
should O
not O
have O
been O
delivered O
in O
the O
dining B
area B
and O
i've O
been O
sitting O
there O
while O
he O
lectured O
another O
customer O
. O

delicious O
crab B
cakes B
too O
. O

now O
at O
the O
top O
of O
our O
list O
, O
del O
frisco's O
steakhouse O
. O

i O
cannot O
imagine O
you O
not O
rushing O
out O
to O
eat O
there O
. O

this O
was O
the O
worst O
dining B
experience B
i've O
ever O
had O
. O

i O
have O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
years O
and O
have O
nothing O
but O
good O
things O
to O
say O
about O
the O
service B
and O
the O
great O
staff B
at O
la O
lanterna O
. O

just O
bring O
someone O
who O
speaks O
cantonese O
because O
waiter B
may O
not O
understand O
you O
. O

i O
thought O
i O
had O
died O
and O
gone O
to O
heaven O
. O

not O
someplace O
i O
would O
seek O
to O
try O
out O
but O
if O
i O
am O
in O
the O
area O
again O
, O
i O
will O
certainly O
stop O
by O
. O

the O
bruschetta B
and O
panini's O
are O
so O
yummy O
! O

food O
was O
okay O
, O
nothing O
great O
. O

every O
waitress B
and O
customer O
who O
passed O
by O
me O
bumped O
into O
my O
chair O
. O

i O
have O
been O
going O
there O
since O
it O
opened O
and O
i O
can't O
get O
enough O
. O

always O
popular O
, O
always O
full O
, O
always O
a O
wait B
. O

in O
fact O
, O
you O
can't O
miss O
it O
. O

i O
recently O
tried O
suan O
and O
i O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
great O
. O

a O
little O
noise O
but O
i O
think O
that O
was O
because O
of O
our O
party O
! O

it O
is O
run O
by O
the O
same O
sichuan O
chef B
who O
started O
the O
chain O
in O
chinatown O
. O

get O
the O
feeling O
they O
settled O
into O
a O
groove O
a O
while O
ago O
. O

if O
the O
omakase O
is O
to O
showcase O
technique O
and O
variety O
, O
serving B
almost O
<number> O
of O
items O
bbq O
ed O
and O
a O
spicy B
tuna B
roll B
wrapped O
with O
not O
so O
fresh O
nori B
seems O
to O
be O
a O
rather O
limp O
performance O
. O

i O
can't O
wait O
for O
summer O
, O
when O
they O
serve O
outside O
on O
their O
gigantic O
patio B
. O

best O
pastrami O
i O
ever O
had O
and O
great O
portion B
without O
being O
ridiculous O
. O

if O
you O
are O
someone O
who O
appreciates O
the O
same O
things O
but O
hope O
to O
have O
food B
to O
spare O
or O
share O
, O
kai O
may O
not O
be O
the O
best O
option O
. O

go O
here O
for O
the O
drinks B
! O

i O
don't O
get O
it O
, O
what's O
so O
special O
about O
prune O
? O

i'd O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
little O
place O
. O

again O
, O
if O
you O
are O
in O
this O
neighborhood O
by O
all O
means O
, O
come O
here O
. O

the O
first O
<number> O
courses B
were O
very O
good O
, O
but O
the O
chocolate B
sampler B
was O
too O
rich O
for O
me O
and O
the O
dessert B
wine B
far O
too O
sweet O
. O

butter O
was O
melted O
, O
white B
wine B
warm O
, O
cheese B
oozing O
everywhere O
. O

we O
had O
a O
party O
in O
their O
private B
room B
and O
they O
made O
it O
truly O
memorable O
and O
were O
very O
helpful O
in O
the O
planning O
. O

do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
walk O
the O
extra O
avenue O
from O
joe's O
to O
eat O
here O
. O

it O
cannot O
be O
the O
ambience B
, O
because O
the O
place B
is O
very O
cramped O
and O
some O
guests O
have O
to O
sit O
in O
an O
aisle B
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
at O
shabu O
tatsu O
at O
least O
<number> O
times O
and O
i O
always O
want O
to O
go O
back O
for O
more O
! O

we O
were O
disappointed O
with O
the O
pre O
fixe O
menu B
of O
only O
<number> O
choices B
per B
course B
other O
restaurants O
offer O
<number> O
choices B
and O
ended O
up O
ordering B
a B
la B
carte B
. O

authentic O
pakistani O
food B
. O

the O
staff B
has O
always O
been O
friendly O
without O
seeming O
grating O
, O
and O
the O
chef B
has O
greeted O
us O
on O
a O
couple O
of O
occasions O
. O

get O
it O
together O
. O

the O
eggplant B
parmesan B
is O
also O
great O
, O
and O
my O
friend O
who O
grew O
up O
in O
manhattan O
claims O
that O
no O
one O
serves B
a O
better O
baked B
ziti B
with B
meatsauce B
. O

quality O
ingredients B
preparation O
all O
around O
, O
and O
a O
very O
fair O
price B
for O
nyc O
. O

service O
was O
very O
good O
prompt O
, O
attentive O
and O
non O
intrusive O
. O

my O
entree B
of O
hot B
pot B
with B
seafood B
was O
full O
of O
imitation O
crabmeat B
with B
a O
couple O
pieces O
of O
shrimp B
and O
squid B
, O
and O
was O
unnecessarily O
heated O
with B
a O
burner O
. O

we O
began O
with O
the O
cheese B
fondue B
the O
artisanal O
blend O
and O
added O
apples B
and O
kielbasa B
to O
dip O
. O

in O
such O
a O
crappy O
part O
of O
town O
to O
find O
a O
good O
value B
for O
lunch B
, O
this O
place O
is O
great O
. O

its O
not O
curry B
in O
a O
slurry O
crap O
, O
and O
regular O
run O
of O
the O
mill O
food B
. O

in O
fact O
, O
while O
leaving O
the O
place O
we O
saw O
two O
people O
looking O
at O
the O
menu B
, O
and O
i O
couldn't O
help O
telling O
them O
that O
the O
food B
was O
horrible O
. O

even O
though O
the O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
, O
we O
were O
seated B
promptly O
and O
even O
asked O
for O
a O
table B
upstairs O
with O
no O
problems O
. O

if O
you O
want O
americanized O
chinese O
food B
with O
your O
usual O
watery O
, O
generic O
white B
sauce B
, O
this O
is O
your O
place O
. O

the O
bread B
is O
the O
soft O
paratha B
bread B
unlike O
the O
plain O
bread B
they O
use O
in O
calcutta O
, O
and O
the O
stuffing B
is O
tandoori B
styled O
and O
very O
flavorful O
. O

service O
is O
friendly O
, O
prices B
are O
good O
delivery B
time B
was O
a O
little O
slow O
, O
but O
for O
the O
way O
this O
pizza B
tastes O
, O
i'm O
willing O
to O
overlook O
it O
. O

the O
food B
can O
get O
pricey O
but O
the O
prixe O
fixe O
tasting O
menu O
is O
the O
greatest O
food B
for O
a O
good O
price B
and O
they O
cater O
the O
food B
to O
any O
food B
allergies O
or O
food B
you O
don't O
like O
. O

the O
service B
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
decor B
is O
great O
, O
and O
the O
food B
is O
delicious O
and O
comes O
in O
large O
portions B
. O

a O
word O
to O
the O
wise O
the O
hoboken O
health O
inspector O
clued O
me O
to O
his O
findings O
that O
this O
is O
the O
cleanest O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

an O
excellent O
service B

the O
food B
however O
, O
is O
what O
one O
might O
expect O
. O

i O
love O
their O
thai O
noodles B
with B
shrimp B
and B
chicken B
and B
coconut B
juice B
is O
the O
must O
! O

i O
must O
give O
it O
yon O
out O
of O
yon O
stars O
! O

the O
pizza B
was O
really O
good O
. O

the O
only O
possible O
drawback O
to O
this O
last O
point O
is O
that O
as O
of O
the O
date O
of O
this O
posting O
, O
the O
additional O
menu B
items B
are O
only O
written O
in O
chinese O
. O

food O
is O
average O
, O
and O
i O
would O
say O
even O
the O
chain O
restaurant O
baluchi's O
tastes O
better O
. O

the O
place B
is O
small O
and O
cramped O
but O
the O
food B
is O
fantastic O
. O

the O
food B
is O
tasty O
and O
portion B
sizes B
are O
appropriate O
. O

a O
little O
crowded O
but O
they O
move O
that O
line O
really O
fast O
! O

enjoy O
! O
! O
! O

kosher O
dills B
are O
the O
perfect O
compliment O
for O
your O
unforgetable O
sandwich B
and O
they O
give O
you O
plenty O
of O
them O
. O

kudos O
to O
po O
! O

the O
entertainment B
was O
great O
they O
have O
shows B
that O
go O
on O
through O
out O
the O
dinner B
. O

my O
boyfriend O
and O
i O
were O
in O
ny O
for O
a O
few O
days O
and O
pastis O
was O
a O
place O
that O
came O
recommended O
. O

the O
food B
is O
so O
cheap O
and O
the O
waiters B
are O
nice O
. O

the O
food B
there O
is O
so O
good O
that O
even O
to O
order O
out O
the O
wait B
is O
incredible O
. O

the O
bartender B
on O
my O
most O
recent O
visit O
was O
so O
incredibly O
rude O
that O
i O
will O
never O
go O
back O
. O

their O
sushi B
, O
kamikaze O
and O
other O
rolls O
are O
fresh O
and O
well O
presented O
. O

for O
authentic O
thai O
food B
, O
look O
no O
further O
than O
toons O
. O

it's O
true O
, O
you O
feel O
like O
your O
in O
a O
scene O
from O
goodfellas O
. O

i O
read O
the O
other O
review O
and O
have O
to O
say O
i O
had O
the O
opposite O
experience O
here O
last O
sunday O
. O

the O
highlight O
of O
the O
night O
was O
the O
mayonaisse B
for O
my O
side O
of O
fries B
i O
received O
from O
one O
of O
the O
food B
runners B
, O
which O
is O
not O
good O
considering O
the O
bill B
was O
nearly O
<number> O
. O

i O
choose O
to O
go O
with O
one O
of O
the O
special B
, O
the O
braised B
lamb B
shank B
in B
red B
wine B
, O
which O
was O
excellent O
. O

if O
anyones O
has O
doubt O
of O
not O
knowing O
enough O
about O
wines B
, O
please O
check O
their O
wine B
list B
. O

never O
again O
! O

the O
only O
concern O
i O
have O
is O
with O
the O
slighly O
all O
business O
waitstaff B
who O
order O
and O
throw O
the O
food B
down O
, O
rushing O
you O
out O
. O

have O
the O
iced B
tea B
. O

for O
park O
avenue O
i O
expected O
so O

chicken B

it O
was O
good O

so O
rude O

you O
can O

get O
<number> O
salads B
worth O
if O
u O
take O
it O
home O
and O
add O
it O
to O
some O
lettuce B
! O

the O
ambience B
is O
very O
romantic O
and O
definitely O
a O
good O
place B
to O
bring O
a O
date O
. O

they O
are O
fast O
. O

it O
is O
far O
more O
popular O
as O
a O
bar B
than O
as O
a O
restaurant O
, O
with O
only O
a O
few O
tables B
and O
the O
waiter B
being O
the O
bartender B
, O
but O
we O
greatly O
enjoyed O
the O
unobtrusive O
atmosphere B
. O

the O
food B
is O
very O
good O
for O
it's O
price B
, O
better O
than O
most O
fried B
dumplings B
i've O
had O
. O

there O
are O
much O
better O
places O
in O
ny O
with O
better O
prices B
. O

very O
neighborhoody O
, O
very O
quick O
and O
sufficient O
. O

obv O
caviar B
is O
top O
of O
the O
line O
but O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
menu B
is O
so O
diverse O
it O
gives O
you O
a O
chance O
to O
taste O
so O
manydifferent O
varietys O
. O

i O
ate O
here O
a O
week O
ago O
and O
found O
most O
dishes B
average O
at O
best O
and O
too O
expensive O
. O

everything O
is O
delicious O
, O
though O
, O
my O
gf O
and O
i O
come O
here O
once O
a O
week O
sometimes O
you O
will O
get O
addicted O
! O

and O
i O
could O
do O
without O
the O
cigar O
smoke O
. O

still O
, O
try O
it O
once O
, O
since O
if O
you O
end O
up O
loving O
the O
food B
, O
it O
could O
be O
one O
of O
your O
best O
dining B
experiences B
. O

i've O
waited O
over O
one O
hour O
for O
food B
. O

other O
guests O
enjoyed O
pizza B
, O
santa B
fe B
chopped B
salad B
and B
fish B
and B
chips B
. O

the O
ambience B
is O
very O
calm O
and O
quiet O
. O

both O
times O
i O
was O
extremely O
dissappointed O
by O
the O
service B
, O
which O
was O
boarderline O
rude O
. O

stay O
away O
from O
the O
latter O
since O
you O
won't O
go O
for O
seconds O
hint O
hint O
. O

not O
only O
does O
make O
the O
best O
pizza B
in O
ny O
, O
maybe O
anywhere O
. O

the O
spicy O
tuna O
roll B
is O
huge O
and O
probably O
the O
best O
that O
i've O
had O
at O
this O
price B
range B
. O

price O
and O
quality B
of O
fish B
alone O
will O
keep O
us O
from O
making O
a O
return O
visit O
. O

our O
waiter B
and O
all O
of O
the O
people O
helping O
him O
were O
attentive O
and O
genuine O
. O

the O
place B
is O
a O
bistro O
which O
means O
simple O
dishes B
and O
wine B
served B
efficiently O
in O
a O
bustling O
atmosphere B
. O

this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
comfort B
food B
places O
in O
the O
city O
. O

overall O
, O
the O
ingredients B
and O
technique B
are O
there O
and O
i O
am O
encouraged O
enough O
to O
return O
at O
lunch B
or O
dinner B
to O
see O
whether O
the O
boldness O
of O
the O
flavour O
palette O
improves O
. O

i O
had O
a O
huge O
pastrami B
sandwich B
on O
a O
roll O
. O

though O
you O
will O
undoubtedly O
be O
seated O
at O
a O
table B
with O
what O
seems O
like O
barely O
enough O
room B
no O
matter O
what O
the O
size O
of O
your O
party O
, O
the O
warm O
atomosphere B
is O
worth O
the O
cramped O
quarters O
you'll O
have O
fun O
and O
forgot O
about O
the O
tight O
spot B
you're O
in O
. O

the O
fish B
was O
not O
fresh O
and O
the O
rice B
tasted O
old O
and O
stale O
. O

considering O
their O
price B
of O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
for O
lunch B
special B
, O
the O
dish B
was O
ridiculously O
small O
. O

this O
is O
the O
pinnacle O
of O
indian O
fast O
food O
all O
fast O
foods O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

besides O
, O
when O
you O
have O
bad O
service B
, O
that's O
less O
money B
you O
have O
to O
tip B
. O

we O
do O
not O
need O
to O
go O
to O
a O
four O
star O
restaurant O
anymore O
. O

the O
wine B
list B
is O
also O
really O
nice O
. O

i O
thanked O
my O
friend O
who O
recommended O
me O
this O
restaurant O
and O
will O
certainly O
recommend O
it O
to O
others O
. O

i O
plan O
on O
stopping O
by O
next O
week O
as O
well O
. O

service O
was O
devine O
, O
oysters B
where O
a O
sensual O
as O
they O
come O
, O
and O
the O
price B
can't O
be O
beat O
! O
! O
! O

compared O
to O
ess O
a O
, O
tal O
offers O
a O
less O
doughy O
bagel B
! O

ballato's O
is O
consistently O
delicious O
authentic O
italian B
food B
. O

the O
service B
was O
attentive O
, O
yet O
discreet O
. O

as O
a O
retired O
hipster O
, O
i O
can O
say O
with O
some O
degree O
of O
certainty O
that O
for O
the O
last O
year O
lucky O
strike O
has O
been O
the O
best O
laid O
back O
late O
night O
in O
the O
city O
. O

for O
those O
prices B
and O
the O
dressed O
up O
atmosphere B
you O
expect O
more O
and O
should O
get O
more O
. O

then O
, O
if O
they O
answer O
the O
phone O
, O
you're O
lucky O
if O
they O
don't O
hang O
up O
on O
you O
! O

they O
offer O
the O
same O
menu B
but O
have O
creative O
drinks B
that O
are O
loaded O
with O
alcohol O
and O
cheeky O
names O
but O
they O
do O
cost O
you O
. O

we O
went O
to O
eat O
at O
the O
jekyll O
and O
hyde O
restaurant O
on O
friday O
night O
and O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
fun O
atmosphere B
and O
good O
food B
. O

the O
food B
was O
pretty O
tradional O
but O
it O
was O
hot O
and O
good O
with O
large O
portions B
. O

highly O
recommended O
to O
all O
! O

highly O
recommended O
. O

unless O
you O
are O
eating O
in O
the O
pizzeria O
side O
of O
this O
place B
, O
and O
are O
not O
in O
a O
rush O
, O
this O
place B
is O
a O
bad O
idea O
. O

you O
have O
to O
increase O
the O
service B
a O
lot O
. O

ambiance O
is O
barely O
romantic O
but O
management B
tries O
. O

i O
must O
warn O
the O
reader O
that O
the O
portions B
sizes O
are O
very O
small O
especially O
the O
appetizers B
, O
so O
if O
you O
plan O
to O
eat O
until O
you O
are O
full O
and O
do O
not O
intend O
to O
order O
the O
chef's O
special O
tasting O
menu B
, O
prepare O
to O
order O
and O
pay O
for O
an O
appetizer B
<number> O
dish B
for O
each O
person O
because O
the O
portions B
are O
not O
for O
sharing O
, O
a O
main B
entree B
, O
and O
the O
cold B
udon B
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
. O

they O
were O
very O
abrupt O
with O
me O
when O
i O
called O
and O
actually O
claimed O
the O
food B
was O
late O
because O
they O
were O
out O
of O
rice B
. O

after O
we O
got O
our O
sashimi B
order O
, O
i O
could O
not O
believe O
how O
small O
the O
portions B
were O
! O

after O
the O
main B
course B
came O
, O
we O
didn't O
see O
our O
waiter B
for O
at O
least O
<number> O
minutes O
! O

it O
will O
be O
on O
my O
to O
do O
list O
the O
next O
visit O
to O
nyc O
. O

nothing O
better O
than O
buying O
a O
snapple B
for O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
too O
. O

when O
family O
came O
in O
he O
gave O
them O
apps B
to O
test O
their O
palets O
, O
and O
then O
ordered O
for O
them O
. O

i O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
find O
this O
gem O
in O
hoboken O
. O

service O
is O
extraordinary O
, O
yet O
not O
overbearing O
, O
and O
the O
decor B
brings O
a O
taste O
of O
trendy O
soho O
into O
queens O
. O

the O
dosas B
are O
skimpy O
, O
unattractive O
and O
drip O
with O
grease O
, O
and O
personally O
i'd O
drink O
popcorn B
topping B
before O
i'd O
eat O
another O
one O
of O
these O
. O

the O
service B
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
food B
was O
delicious O
. O

if O
i O
wanted O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
crappy O
scene B
and O
annoying O
customers B
i'd O
go O
out O
in O
manhattan O
. O

after O
a O
seafood B
craving O
, O
i O
checked O
citysearch O
and O
chose O
to O
go O
to O
fish O
based O
on O
a O
previous O
review O
and O
the O
citysearch O
info O
. O

right O
off O
the O
major O
deegan O
you O
get O
ladies B
from O
all O
over O
the O
city O
. O

until O
you O
realize O
that O
their O
five O
minutes O
is O
meaningless O
and O
your O
wait B
may O
be O
anywhere O
from O
two O
to O
twenty O
minutes O
it O
may O
be O
frustrating O
. O

always O
fresh O
and O
delicious O
. O

the O
food B
was O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O
very O
thai O
. O

thalia O
is O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant O
with O
beautiful O
people B
serving B
you O
, O
but O
the O
food B
doesn't O
quite O
match O
up O
. O

the O
fillings B
may O
be O
unconventional O
but O
the O
dosa B
batter B
is O
definitely O
authentic O
and O
the O
combinations O
very O
tasty O
. O

this O
is O
the O
perfect O
spot B
for O
meeting O
friends O
, O
having O
lunch B
, O
dinner B
, O
pre O
theatre O
or B
after O
theatre O
drinks B
! O

this O
is O
a O
fun O
restaurant O
to O
go O
to O
. O

the O
mussaman B
curry B
that O
i O
ordered O
was O
as O
thin O
as O
water O
and O
aside O
from O
the O
poorly O
fried B
tofu B
that O
i O
ordered O
in O
it O
, O
they O
graciously O
provided O
me O
with O
one O
piece O
of O
poorly O
cooked O
potato B
. O

had O
a O
late O
night O
dinner B
on O
a O
saturday O
night O
. O

a O
restaurant O
that O
doesn't O
try O
to O
do O
anything O
except O
serve O
great O
food B
with O
great O
service B
in O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere B
. O

their O
sake B
martini B
is O
wonderful O
. O

well O
, O
this O
place B
is O
so O
ghetto O
its O
not O
even O
funny O
. O

bravissimo O
! O
! O

once O
they O
ran O
out O
of O
gnochi O
and O
made O
it O
for O
me O
from O
scratch O
! O

we O
would O
like O
to O
thank O
marcelo O
and O
grace O
for O
a O
wonderful O
dining B
experience O
! O
! O
! O

found O
service B
above O
average O
, O
but O
that O
could O
be O
because O
we O
were O
<number> O
of O
us O
. O

when O
i O
arrived O
at O
orsay O
i O
was O
thrown O
back O
, O
in O
a O
veyr O
good O
sense O
. O

bagels O
are O
ok O
, O
but O
be O
sure O
not O
to O
make O
any O
special O
requests O
! O

this O
is O
the O
cheers O
of O
new O
york O
, O
whether O
you've O
ever O
been O
there O
or O
not O
. O

it's O
to O
die O
for O
! O

cute O
and O
decorative O
. O

i O
know O
this O
is O
the O
case O
in O
many O
nyc O
eateries O
, O
but O
here O
, O
they O
really O
cram O
you O
in O
to O
the O
point O
where O
it's O
borderline O
uncomfortable O
. O

fine O
dining O
restaurant O
quality B
. O

overall O
a O
disappointing O
experience O
for O
that O
price B
category O
. O

i've O
had O
the O
lunch B
buffet B
at O
chennai O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
, O
when O
i O
have O
been O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

the O
food B
was O
exceptional O
. O

you O
will O
be O
satisfied O
. O

another O
great O
place O
to O
take O
out O
of O
towners O
! O

but O
, O
hey O
, O
there O
is O
anything O
better O
with O
a O
decent O
vegetarian O
selection O
in O
astoria O
. O

we O
were O
less O
than O
impressed O
. O

a O
thai O
restaurant O
out O
of O
rice B
during O
dinner B
? O

but O
still O
my O
date O
was O
bad O

would O
definitely O
go O
back O
again O
. O

i O
have O
been O
to O
rao's O
probably O
<number> O
times O
the O
past O
<number> O
years O
and O
it O
keeps O
getting O
better O
. O

the O
portions B
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O
. O

and O
i O
have O
eaten O
my O
share O
which O
impresses O
me O
for O
having O
such O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
people O
to O
serve B
. O

sure O
, O
the O
setting B
is O
nice O
. O

overall O
a O
worthwhile O
experience O
. O

the O
service B
is O
friendly O
, O
if O
not O
the O
most O
prompt O
in O
the O
world O
, O
the O
food B
is O
great O
, O
and O
the O
prices B

while O
not O
cheap O
, O
won't O
put O
your O
wallet O
out O

it's O
really O
a O
takeaway O
place O
, O
i O
wouldn't O
sit O
if O
i O
could O
take O
it O
home O
. O

the O
most O
fun O
restaurant O
i O
have O
ever O
been O
too O
! O

best O
drumsticks B

their O

it O
all O

nobody O
at O
this O
restaurant O
will O
give O
firm O
answers O
about O
anything O
and O
in O
the O
end O
, O
not O
one O
person O
takes O
responsibility O
for O
anything O
. O

i O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
. O

the O
chicken B
parm B
was O
edible O
but O
had O
canned O
tomato B
sauce B
and O
boxed O
pasta B
and O
the O
chicken B
with B
portobello B
mushrooms B
consisted O
of O
dry O
, O
inedible O
chicken B
with B
terrible O
sauce B
. O

i O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
everyone O
who O
asks O
me O
where O
to O
go O
for O
a O
good O
meal B
. O

the O
waitresses B
are O
nice O
also O
you O
can O
just O

go O
for O
it O

highly O
recommended O

you O
can O
certainly O
find O
restaurants O
that O
offer O
a O
superior O
fine O

i O
cannot O
imagine O
a O
friendlier O

working O
in O
a O
restaurant O

i O
do O
suggest O
to O
ask O

you O
are O
looking O
to O
be O

little O

to O

the O

the O

but O
definitely O
not O
great O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
roxy's O
for O
that O
, O
but O
not O
for O
their O
food B
. O

we O
always O
get O
a O
sampling O
of O
appetizers B
and O
share O
. O

overall O
i O
was O
impressed O
and O
will O
return O
, O
it's O
a O
great O
qpr O
quality O
to O
price O
ratio O
. O

it O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table B
, O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner B
, O
do O
not O
pass O
it O
up O
. O

their O
pad B
penang B
is O
delicious O
and O
everything O
else O
is O
fantastic O
. O

the O
puke O
green O
walls B
leave O
a O
lot O
to O
be O
desired O
, O
but O
the O
food B
is O
very O
good O
. O

the O
flavors B
are O
very O
fresh O
and O
pretty O
inobtrusive O
, O
nothing O
flashy O
. O

i O
like O
cafe O
noir O
dont O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
it O
is O
jsut O
that O
the O
people B
who O
work O
there O
are O
evil O
and O
incompetent O
! O
! O

the O
hanger B
steak B
was O
like O
rubber O
and O
the O
tuna B
was O
flavorless O
not O
to O
mention O
it O
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
just O
been O
thawed O
. O

but O
<number> O
for O
each O
small O
piece O
? O
? O
? O

our O
son O
loves O
pizza B
and O
we O
have O
a O
certified O
neapolitan O
pizzaria O
in O
our O
home O
city O
seattle O
, O
we O
liked O
this O
nearly O
as O
much O
and O
the O
differences O
were O
more O
about O
personal O
preference O
than O
any O
reflection O
on O
either O
restaurant O
. O

big O
and O
soft O
as O
well O
as O
good O
lunch B
food B
. O

no O
food B
snobs O
allowed O
, O
this O
place O
is O
for O
people O
who O
appreciate O
good O
food B
. O

i O
liked O
the O
food B
at O
this O
quasi O
thai O
restaurant O
. O

by O
far O
the O
best O
salad B
i O
have O
had O
in O
a O
fast B
food B
restaurant O
. O

suan O
is O
a O
great O
place O
that O
i O
often O
take O
my O
friends O
classmates O
too O
. O

not O
a O
great O
place O
for O
family O
or O
general O
dining O
. O

as O
for O
the O
bar B
, O
this O
is O
another O
bad O
idea O
. O

their O
bagels B
are O
fine O
, O
but O
they O
are O
a O
little O
overcooked O
, O
and O
not O
really O
a O
'special' O
bagel B
experience O
. O

unlike O
hh O
up O
the O
block O
, O
this O
place O
actually O
gives O
you O
hearty O
and O
hot O
bagels B
this O
town O
is O
known O
for O
. O

i O
thought O
going O
to O
jimmys O
would O
give O
me O
a O
real O
domincan O
exprience O
. O

the O
barebecued B
salmon B
is O
elegantly O
spiced O
and O
not O
at O
all O
dry O
. O

same O
owner B
as O
the O
guy O
who O
owns O
typhoon O
, O
which O
is O
just O
down O
the O
street O
on O
st O
. O
marks O
and O
1st O
ave O
. O

what O
generous O
portions B
! O

the O
workers B
there O
also O
absolutely O
load O
the O
bagel B
with O
cream B
cheese B
gets O
a O
little O
messy O
. O

i O
was O
wrong O
. O

the O
wine B
the O
service B
was O
very O
good O
too O
. O

so O
, O
the O
menu B
is O
written O
in O
chalk O
above O
your O
head O
and O
it O
all O
sounds O
delicious O
. O

the O
highly O
spiced O
chai B
tea B
was O
great O
too O
. O

no O
plans O
to O
return O
anytime O
soon O
. O

i O
have O
been O
there O
many O
times O
, O
and O
food B
is O
good O
and O
consistent O
. O

seriously O
, O
this O
is O
the O
best O
all O
you O
can O
eat O
in O
town O
as O
everyone O
says O
, O
the O
spicy O
tuna O
hand B
rolls B
are O
the O
best O
have O
<number> O
of O
these O
, O
and O
you've O
broken O
even O
. O

there O
is O
not O
a O
single O
place O
in O
chinatown O
where O
you O
have O
a O
nice O
neighborhood O
feeling O
like O
here O
. O

while O
sapphire O
is O
certainly O
not O
lacking O
in O
ambiance B
, O
and O
probably O
has O
the O
best O
decor B
of O
any O
indian O
restaurant O
i O
have O
been O
to O
in O
new O
york O
city O
, O
the O
food B
was O
not O
what O
i O
had O
hoped O
for O
. O

i O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
casual O
atmosphere B
that O
whisks O
you O
away O
to O
the O
left O
bank O
of O
the O
river O
seine O
. O

i O
just O
do O
not O
understand O
what O
the O
fuss O
is O
all O
about O
. O

the O
meat B
dishes B
were O
only O
so O
so O
. O

his O
wife O
tanya O
, O
the O
hostess B
, O
completes O
the O
comforting O
atmosphere B
by O
being O
delightfully O
warm O
and O
gracious O
. O

we O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
, O
that O
we O
will O
always O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
dine O
here O
when O
we O
visit O
new O
york O
. O

the O
menu B
consisted O
of O
standard O
brassiere B
food B
, O
better O
then O
places O
like O
balthazar O
etc O
. O

i O
have O
been O
a O
longtime O
fan O
of O
holy O
basil O
in O
the O
east O
village O
, O
and O
while O
i O
do O
believe O
their O
food B
has O
slightly O
slipped O
in O
quality B
, O
i O
have O
been O
hesitant O
to O
be O
disloyal O
. O

but O
the O
best O
part O
about O
ls O
is O
the O
late O
night O
atmosphere B
, O
delightfully O
free O
of O
the O
bts O
. O

for O
an O
untrendy O
rip O
off O
eat O
here O
. O

and O
you're O
hungry O
a O
few O
hours O
later O
. O

i O
can't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

i O
hate O
hate O
hate O
this O
place O
. O

we O
even O
had O
a O
visit O
from O
the O
manager O
who O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
we O
were O
enjoying O
ourselves O
. O

the O
staff B
there O
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
down O
to O
earth O
. O

you O
don't O
go O
to O
mizu O
for O
excellent O
service B
, O
you O
go O
for O
the O
large O
amounts O
of O
food B
, O
the O
amiable O
atmosphere B
, O
and O
the O
hole O
in O
the O
wall O
feeling O
of O
the O
place O
. O

the O
service B
is O
always O
bad O
though O
, O
don't O
expect O
much O
of O
anything O
from O
your O
server B
, O
and O
i O
would O
not O
recommend O
bringing O
a O
date O
here O
either O
. O

monday O
nights O
are O
a O
bargain O
at O
the O
<number> O
prix B
fix B
this O
includes O
a O
three B
course B
meal B
plus O
three B
glasses B
of B
wine B
paired O
with O
each O
course B
. O

wonderful O
! O

it O
took O
them O
<number> O
minutes O
to O
put O
water B
in O
our O
glasses O
. O

the O
service B
is O
descent O
even O
when O
this O
small O
place B
is O
packed O
. O

this O
is O
the O
best O
sushi B
in O
new O
york O
city O
hands O
down O
. O

go O
hungry O
and O
enjoy O
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
a O
lot O
of O
pizza B
here O
. O

this O
place O
is O
worth O
an O
one O
hour O
drive O
. O

great O
value O
for O
the O
quality O
ingredients B
. O

the O
thali O
was O
small O
, O
thoroughly O
unremarkable O
, O
and O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
. O

the O
sushi B
is O
also O
great O
! O

from O
the O
complimentary O
chef B
app B
of O
a B
delicate B
butternut B
squash B
ravioli B
in B
a B
delicious B
truffle B
sauce B
to O
an O
amazing O
buttery B
and B
tender B
langostine B
entree B
to O
a B
dessert B
that O
i O
can't O
remember O
because O
of O
the O
fabulous O
cakebread O
cabernet O
we O
were O
drinking O
the O
whole O
evening O
was O
amazing O
. O

truly O
the O
mark O
of O
an O
attentive O
waiter B
. O

the O
food B
here O
is O
rather O
good O
, O
but O
only O
if O
you O
like O
to O
wait O
for O
it O
. O

i O
got O
an O
excellent O
piece O
of O
cheesecake B
and O
we O
had O
several O
other O
nice O
pastries B
. O

the O
staff B
is O
very O
kind O
and O
well O
trained O
, O
they're O
fast O
, O
they O
are O
always O
prompt O
to O
jump O
behind O
the O
bar B
and O
fix O
drinks B
, O
they O
know O
details O
of O
every O
item O
in O
the O
menu B
and O
make O
excelent O
recomendations O
. O

the O
makhani B
was O
ok O
the O
korma B
was O
bland O
. O

the O
food B
is O
inventive O
but O
still O
keeps O
traditional O
indian O
flavoring O
. O

all O
i O
can O
say O
is O
wow O
! O

though O
the O
service B
could O
be O
better O
possibly O
due O
to O
more O
than O
one O
very O
large O
group O
in O
the O
house O
, O
it O
is O
very O
cordial O
and O
warm O
, O
as O
is O
the O
general O
clientele O
. O

the O
decor B
in O
this O
place B
is O
very O
diner O
ish O
and O
the O
kind O
of O
place B
you O
expect O
in O
the O
east O
village O
not O
romantic O
, O
just O
simple O
, O
small O
and O
sparse O
. O

this O
is O
a O
cute O
place B
and O
could O
be O
good O
but O
they O
need O
to O
get O
their O
act O
together O
. O

the O
lox B
is O
always O
fresh O
too O
. O

sure O
enough O
, O
exactly O
<number> O
minutes O
later O
we O
got O
the O
call O
and O
were O
seated O
promptly O
. O

service O
was O
very O
friendly O
. O

so O
all O
i'm O
trying O
to O
say O
is O
this O
restaurant O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
thai B
food B
restaurant O
i've O
ever O
been O
to O
. O

food O
was O
ok O
fish B
was O
cooked O
well O
. O

we O
actually O
left O
hungry O
and O
went O
across O
the O
street O
to O
wo O
hop O
at O
<number> O
mott O
street O
for O
some O
good O
chinese B
food B
. O

the O
duck B
confit B
is O
always O
amazing O
and O
the O
foie B
gras B
terrine B
with B
figs B
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

the O
whole O
set O
up O
is O
truly O
unprofessional O
and O
i O
wish O
cafe O
noir O
would O
get O
some O
good O
staff B
, O
because O
despite O
the O
current O
one O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place O
. O

the O
service B
does O
sometimes O
lack O
focus O
and O
it O
is O
not O
ideal O
if O
you O
are O
in O
a O
hurry O
but O
i O
have O
never O
been O
treated O
rudely O
. O

the O
staff B
offers O
impeccable O
service B
. O

the O
catch O
is O
that O
you O
are O
charged O
extra O
for O
anything O
that O
you O
leave O
on O
your O
plate O
so O
don't O
be O
a O
greedy O
pig O
! O

we O
ended O
our O
great O
experience O
by O
having O
gulab O
jamun O
dessert O
recommended O
by O
the O
waiter B
. O

wont O
come O
back O
again O
for O
sure O
! O

i O
went O
to O
utsav O
about O
a O
yr O
ago O
with O
my O
family O
. O

this O
place O
doesn't O
compare O
with O
mamoun's O
in O
terms O
of O
price B
, O
freshness B
, O
value B
, O
and O
consisent O
quality B
, O
but O
that's O
just O
my O
opinion O
. O

the O
place B
is O
sleek O
, O
modern O
and O
playfull O
and O
i O
will O
return O
again O
frequently O
. O

i O
have O
known O
about O
this O
secret O
for O
the O
last O
<number> O
years O
, O
emilio O
the O
godfather O
has O
continued O
to O
serve O
food B
and O
wine B
for O
the O
gods O
at O
mortal O
prices B
. O

the O
brioche B
and B
lollies B
as O
party O
favors O
is O
a O
cute O
and B
sweet O
touch O
to O
a O
most O
memorable O
meal B
. O

after O
being O
told O
that O
our O
party O
of O
three O
would O
be O
seated O
in O
<number> O
minutes O
and O
watching O
other O
parties O
multiples O
of O
<number> O
and O
higher O
seated O
for O
<number> O
minutes O
, O
the O
three O
of O
us O
were O
squished O
into O
a O
small O
<number> O
person O
table B
. O

and O
the O
bill B
was O
outragous O
. O

the O
service B
was O
attentive O
, O
yet O
unimposing O
, O
the O
food B
was O
far O
better O
than O
many O
notorious O
restaurants O
in O
midtown O
and O
the O
wine B
list B
is O
extensive O
and O
well O
priced B
. O

kind O
, O
attentive O
wait B
staff B

bon O
appettite O
! O
! O

salads O
were O
fantastic O

the O
owners B
and O

are O
friendly O
and O
their O
pizza B
is O
fantastic O
. O

la O
rosa O
waltzes O
in O
, O
and O
i O
think O
they O
are O
doing O
it O
the O
best O
. O

the O
food B
is O
yummy O
, O
especially O
their O
cooked O
to O
perfection O
mussels B
in B
spicy B
tomato B
sauce B
and O
their O
shoestring O
crispy O
fries B
. O

the O
food B
is O
authentic O
italian O
delicious O
! O

a O
great O
addition O
to O
smith O
street O
finally O
, O
a O
place O
that's O
not O
pretentious O
and O
filled O
with O
women O
wearing O
ugg O
boots O
. O

skip O
dessert B

we O
spent O
<number> O
in O
this O
place O
and O
left O
hungry O
and O
very O
disappointed O
. O

it O
is O
simply O
amazing O
. O

i O
complete O
the O
total O
bagel B
experience O
by O
having O
it O
lightly O
toasted O
. O

it O
was O
like O
the O
servers B
forgot O
that O
they O
actually O
worked O
there O
and O
instead O
wanted O
to O
hang O
out O
and O
be O
cool O
. O

i O
liked O
this O
place O
the O
first O
time O
but O
doubt O
i O
will O
ever O
return O
. O

the O
service B
is O
good O
and O
ambience B
is O
good O
for O
a O
date O
or O
group O
outing O
. O

a O
great O
way O
to O
make O
some O
money O
is O
to O
buy O
a O
case B
of B
snapple B
from O
costco O
and O
sell O
it O
right O
outside O
for O
only O

about O

the O
service B
was O
bad O
, O
the O
food B
took O
to O
forever O
to O
come O
, O
we O
sat O
on O
the O
upper O
level O
. O

we O
a O

they O
put O
in O
thier O
food B

always O
full O
with O

especially O
because O
of O
it's O
close O
proximity O
to O
rockefeller O
center O
. O

the O
decor B
is O
nice O
, O
but O
more O
casual O
than O
fine O
dining O
. O

this O
restaurant O
is O
a O
wonderful O
place O
to O
go O
many O
times O
and O
it O
is O

the O
only O
thing O
the O
waiters B
don't O
do O
for O
you O
is O

empty O
and O
the O
staff B
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O
and O
they O
were O
very O
rude O
. O

at O
<number> O
<number> O
, O
we O
were O
the O
third O
party O
there O
. O

delicious O
simple O
food B
in O
nice O
outdoor O
atmosphere B
. O

i O
will O
definetly O
be O
going O
back O
. O

no O
, O
really O
. O

the O
food B
is O
good O
, O
but O
very O
expensive O
for O
the O
casualness O
of O
it O
. O

the O
only O
fallback O
on O
this O
restaurant O
is O
the O
prices B
. O

i've O
been O
to O
naples O
<number> O
for O
dinner B
twice O
. O

the O
hot O
and O
sour O
soup B
was O
unbearably O
hot O
and O
tasted O
of O
only O
pepper B
and O
nothing O
else O
. O

i O
love O
the O
pics O
of O
andy O
warhol O
when O
he O
used O
to O
frequent O
the O
place O
he O
painted O
the O
ballato's O
sign O
in O
the O
window O
. O

try O
sushimi B
cucumber B
roll B
. O

i'm O
saving O
up O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

the O
food B
is O
delicious O
. O

their O
wines B
by B
the B
glass B
are O
a O
great O
accompaniment O
and O
you O
can O
eat O
like O
a O
king O
with O
wine B
for O
under O
<number> O
. O

this O
place B
has O
the O
the O
correct O
ambience B
and O
an O
excellent O
staff B
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
guest O
and O
a O
friend O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

amma O
is O
nothing O
special O
. O

yeah O
shanghai O
is O
also O
great O
but O
not O
quite O
as O
good O
they O
use O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
salt B
but O
without O
sweetness O
to O
balance O
out O
. O

believe O
us O
, O
we've O
been O
eating O
sushi B
for O
over O
<number> O
yrs O
. O

worth O
it O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
, O
or O
any O
time O
! O

the O
atmosphere B
is O
much O
better O
than O
sripraphai O
more O
modern O
and O
sleek O
. O

i O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
to O
dress O
up O
and O
impress O
the O
lady O
. O

the O
food B
is O
outstanding O
and O
the O
service B
is O
quick O
, O
friendly O
and O
very O
professional O
. O

the O
bagels B
always O
warm O
, O
soft O
on O
the O
inside O
, O
crispy O
on O
the O
outside O
and O
enormous O
in O
size O
. O

i O
had O
a O
late O
dinner B
at O
lucky O
stike O
, O
a O
great O
name O
for O
a O
joint O
if O
ever O
i O
saw O
one O
. O

been O
there O
, O
done O
that O
, O
and O
new O
york O
, O
it's O
not O
that O
big O
a O
deal O
. O

definitely O
a O
once O
a O
year O
treat O
that O
i O
look O
forward O
to O
around O
the O
holidays O
! O

service O
is O
fast O
and O
friendly O
. O

from O
an O
english O
speaking O
staff B
. O

anyhow O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
sit O
as O
long O
as O
we O
wanted O
and O
chat O
, O
which O
was O
nice O
. O

and O
they O
have O
these O
home O
made O
potato B
chips B
at O
the O
bar B
that O
are O
the O
most O
delicious O
things O
in O
the O
world O
! O

a O
defitely O
must O
visit O
. O

my O
husband O
and O
i O
enjoyed O
each O
of O
the O
<number> O
taste O
size O
portions B
and O
left O
completely O
full O
. O

i O
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim O
, O
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and O
couldn't O
get O
a O
table B
. O

we O
all O
ate O
pasta B
entre'es B
, O
which O
were O
great O
. O

my O
friends O
and O
i O
showed O
up O
on O
a O
sat O
. O

the O
steak B
was O
excellent O
and O
one O
of O
the O
best O
i O
have O
had O
i O
tasted O
the O
butter B
intitally O
but O
in O
no O
way O
did O
it O
overwhelm O
the O
flavor B
of O
the O
meat B
. O

great O
experience O
overall O
. O

perfect O
for O
dates O
! O

the O
food B
was O
boring O
and O
expensive O
. O

the O
ambience B
is O
pretty O
and O
nice O
for O
conversation O
, O
so O
a O
casual O
lunch B
here O
would O
probably O
be O
best O
. O

terrific O
menu B
full O
of O
unique O
rolls B
and O
special O
dishes B
. O

the O
service B
is O
ok O
but O
could O
be O
better O
. O

we O
love O
the O
food B
, O
drinks B
, O
and O
atmosphere B
! O

i O
was O
here O
a O
few O
weeks O
back O
and O
we O
had O
the O
worst O
customer B
service B
experience O
at O
a O
restaurant O
ever O
. O

i've O
ordered O
from O
the O
2nd O
ave O
. O

nothing O
against O
a O
good O
sales O
call O
, O
but O
the O
tactics O
at O
amma O
are O
just O
too O
obvious O
. O

went O
on O
a O
<number> O
day O
oyster B
binge O
, O
with O
fish O
bringing O
up O
the O
closing O
, O
and O
i O
am O
so O
glad O
this O
was O
the O
place B
it O
o O
trip O
ended O
, O
because O
it O
was O
so O
great O
! O

took O
my O
mom O
for O
mother's O
day O
, O
and O
the O
maitre B
d' B
was O
pretty O
rude O
. O

my O
husband O
and O
i O
have O
been O
there O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
and O
each O
time O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
sushi B
bar B
chef B
yoshi O
and O
ordered O
everything O
ala B
carte B
. O

the O
vibe B
is O
very O
relaxed O
and O
cozy O
, O
service B
was O
great O
and O
the O
food B
was O
excellent O
! O

if O
the O
weather O
is O
nice O
, O
try O
to O
snag O
an O
outside O
table B
. O

if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
quality B
, O
cheap O
eats O
this O
is O
the O
place O
. O

however O
, O
for O
what O
we O
spent O
, O
overall O
, O
it O
just O
was O
not O
up O
to O
par O
. O

the O
service B
was O
friendly O
and O
the O
atmosphere B
was O
casual O
. O

a O
friend O
from O
seattle O
and O
i O
went O
on O
a O
thursday O
night O
around O
<number> O
<number> O
. O

when O
i O
lived O
upstate O
for O
a O
while O
i O
would O
buy O
freeze O
the O
bagels B
and O
they O
would O
still O
be O
better O
than O
any O
else O
. O

i O
recommend O
their O
pad O
see O
ew O
, O
pork O
chops O
or O
tofu O
plates B
. O

never O
in O
my O
life O
did O
i O
think O
that O
i O
could O
be O
satisfied O
both O
in O
taste B
and O
in O
quantity B
for O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
in O
nyc O
. O

this O
is O
the O
best O
secret O
place O
in O
midtown' O
, O
i O
heard O
that O
from O
the O
bartender B
, O
after O
having O
brilliant O
food B
try O
steak B
with B
portobello B
mushrooms B
and O
drinks B
on O
the O
bar B
last O
tuesday O
. O

the O
service B
was O
excellent O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

the O
main B
course B
had O
an O
average O
portion B
, O
and O
was O
decent O
overall O
. O

<number> O
minutes O
for O
our O
reservation B
but O
it O
gave O
us O
time O
to O
have O
a O
few O
cocktails B
and O
enjoy O
our O
surroundings B
and O
each O
other O
. O

just O
remember O
, O
the O
later O
you O
go O
, O
the O
longer O
you O
may O
have O
to O
wait O
. O

waitstaff O
is O
great O
, O
very O
attentive O
. O

i O
live O
in O
the O
neightborhood O
and O
am O
a O
regular O
. O

the O
dinner B
menu B
is O
diverse O
and O
top O
notch O
as O
well O
. O

it O
is O
what O
modern O
cuisine O
is O
all O
about O
. O

in O
any O
event O
, O
even O
though O
its O
a O
bit O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
, O
we O
still O
love O
this O
restaurant O
and O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
. O

i O
definitely O
will O
go O
back O
. O

i O
don't O
like O
indian O
food B
too O
much O
and O
this O
was O
delicious O
, O
however O
you O
want O
to O
factor O
that O
into O
the O
equation O
. O

at O
taj O
, O
vegetarians O
can O
rejoice O
all O
the O
dishes B
are O
manna O
from O
heaven O
. O

finally O
! O

forget O
the O
rush B
and O
the O
wait B
and O
the O
noise B
which O
isn't O
actually O
that O
bad O
, O
i O
mean O
please O
, O
who O
goes O
to O
a O
steakhouse O
to O
be O
coddled O
and O
romantic O
? O

having O
hunted O
around O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
romantic O
, O
yet O
not O
hideously O
expensive O
restaurant O
i O
stumbled O
across O
reviews O
for O
la O
lanterna O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
shot O
. O

i've O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

i O
won't O
go O
back O
unless O
someone O
else O
is O
footing O
the O
bill B
. O

we O
live O
in O
new O
jersey O
and O
whenever O
we O
go O
into O
new O
york O
city O
we O
buy O
bagels B
to O
eat O
hot O
and O
then O
to O
freeze O
they O
told O
me O
that O
if O
i O
call O
in O
the O
order O
, O
they'd O
bring O
it O
out O
to O
the O
car O
so O
i O
wouldn't O
have O
to O
look O
for O
parking O
. O

from O
the O
street O
it O
looks O
very O
hidden O
, O
and O
is O
actually O
an O
old O
warehouse O
. O

jimmy's O
is O
hands O
down O
the O
hottest O
night O
spot B
in O
the O
bronx O
. O

and O
i O
would O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
masses O
in O
terms O
of O
service B
delivery B
is O
their O
achilles' O
heel O
. O

my O
boyfriend O
and O
i O
have O
been O
to O
the O
minnow O
four O
times O
now O
and O
we O
have O
consistently O
been O
impressed O
. O

the O
<number> O
bill B
was O
a O
bit O
steep O
, O
but O
the O
experience O
was O
great O
. O

i O
wouldn't O
mind O
going O
back O
some O
time O
, O
but O
not O
before O
trying O
others O
nearby O
. O

nice O
ambiance B
, O
nice O
little O
bar B
, O
good O
bartender B
, O
francois O
, O
and O
good O
service B
. O

i O
found O
this O
restaurant O
to O
be O
one O
that O
truly O
values O
its O
patrons O
. O

the O
calamari B
comes O
with O
an O
incredible O
sauce B
, O
and O
the O
duck B
noodles B
are O
yummy O
as O
well O
. O

i O
would O
definitely O
go O
back O
if O
only O
for O
some O
of O
those O
exotic O
martinis B
on O
the O
blackboard O
. O

for O
some O
reason O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
when O
we O
got O
in O
and O
remained O
so O
for O
the O
entire O
evening O
, O
i O
don't O
understand O
why O
but O
we O
had O
a O
blast O
and O
will O
definately O
go O
back O
the O
next O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
area O
. O

simple O
comfort B
food B
and O
what O
hot O
and O
lage O
portions B
. O

but O
i O
just O
would O
like O
to O
say O
i O
read O
the O
reviews O
people O
left O
and O
thats O
why O
i O
checked O
it O
out O
. O

stay O
away O
from O
the O
two O
specialty O
rolls B
on O
the O
menu B
, O
though O
too O
much O
avocado B
and O
rice B
will O
fill O
you O
up O
right O
quick O
. O

i've O
eaten O
at O
pizza O
gruppo O
a O
few O
times O
, O
but O
more O
often O
i O
order O
delivery O
. O

we O
didn't O
get O
drink B
refills B
and O
she O
didn't O
even O
offer O
us O
the O
option O
of O
dessert B
. O

beautiful O
experience O
. O

the O
bagels B
are O
also O
reasonably O
priced B
for O
nyc O
. O

if O
you O
can O
handle O
that O
, O
it's O
a O
great O
place O
for O
a O
business B
dinner B
, O
fun O
with O
friends O
or O
simply O
a O
table B
for O
<number> O
. O

decor O
leaves O
something O
to O
be O
desired O
. O

jimmy O
is O
dominican O
! O

also O
, O
specify O
if O
you O
like O
your O
food B
spicy O
its O
rather O
bland O
if O
you O
don't O
. O

our O
waiter B
was O
fine O
, O
the O
place B
looks O
nice O
in O
that O
not O
trying O
too O
hard O
way O
, O
but O
at O
those O
prices B
, O
a O
little O
more O
should O
be O
expected O
of O
your O
food B
. O

coming O
from O
boston O
this O
place O
is O
like O
emma's O
pizza O
in O
kendall O
square O
in O
cambridge O
although O
they O
have O
more O
funky O
toppings B
! O

when O
my O
husband O
and O
go O
there O
, O
we O
spend O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
have O
lobster O
tails O
ummmmm O
need O
i O
say O
more O
i O
can't O
say O
any O
more O
, O
it O
a O
place B
you'll O
never O
forget O
if O
you O
never O
go O
, O
you'll O
miss O
a O
meal O
of O
your O
life O
time O

in O
an O
effort O
to O
increase O
turnover O
, O
the O
restaurant O
offers O
no O
desserts B
beyond O
the O
complimentary O
espresso B
cup B
filled B
with B
chocolate B
mousse B
. O

i've O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
more O
than O
a O
dozen O
times O
and O
when O
i'm O
craving O
for O
pho O
, O
lemon O
grass B
chicken B
or O
beef O
cube O
on B
rice B
, O
this O
is O
the O
place O
to O
go O
. O

oh O
yes O
, O
and O
if O
you O
are O
a O
fan O
of O
indian O
oldies O
film O
stars O
, O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
portraits B
of O
indian O
actors O
and O
actresses O
in O
classic O
black O
white O
that O
adorn O
the O
walls O
, O
some O
of O
which O
, O
i O
would O
love O
to O
know O
where O
they O
obtained O
. O

the O
food B
is O
spectacular O
, O
from O
the O
appitizers B
to O
the O
main B
course B
, O
and O
then O
of O
course B
the O
desserts B
, O
wow O
you'll O
need O
no O
more O
. O

the O
neighborhood O
was O
nice O
though O
so O
check O
out O
another O
restaurant O
instead O
. O

my O
fish B
was O
delicious O
in O
an O
incredible O
curry B
sauce B
. O

if O
you O
are O
in O
search O
of O
the O
most O
authentic O
nyc O
deli B
experience O
look O
no O
further O
than O
the O
famous O
and O
historic O
katz's O
deli B
down O
on O
the O
lower O
east O
side O
. O

even O
upon O
delivery O
, O
their O
juicy O
pork B
buns B
are O
quite O
good O
. O
. O

this O
is O
also O
where O
i O
was O
from O
. O

everything O
is O
for O
sale O
in O
here O
including O
the O
sculptured O
iron O
statue O
on O
the O
table O
. O

average O
to O
good O
thai O
food B
, O
but O
terrible O
delivery B
. O

the O
space B
is O
nice O
but O
when O
we O
order O
our O
drink B
we O
were O
in O
for O
a O
surprise O
. O

the O
entire O
place B
and O
the O
treatment O
we O
received O
felt O
as O
a O
conveyor O
belt O
. O

joe's O
pizza O
used O
to O
have O
the O
best O
slice B
until O
this O
pizzeria O
opened O
up O
. O

i O
in O
all O
reality O
felt O
as O
if O
i O
had O
just O
gotten O
off O
air O
france O
and O
was O
in O
the O
8th O
district O
in O
paris O
. O

i O
have O
never O
had O
anything O
like O
it O
! O

yeah O
the O
crowd O
can O
take O
it O
a O
bit O
seriously O
, O
but O
it O
shouldn't O
. O

and O
they O
provided O
a O
delicious O
dessert B
on O
the O
house O
! O

they O
are O
still O
living O
in O
the O
dark O
ages O
and O
do O
not O
have O
an O
answering O
machine O
, O
so O
if O
you O
want O
to O
make O
a O
reservation B
you O
are O
limited O
. O

the O
food B
is O
amazing O
, O
rich O
pastas B
and O
fresh O
doughy O
pizza B
. O

food O
was O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O
what O
i O
would O
consider O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

i O
had O
lobster O
bisque O
it O
has O
<number> O
oz O
. O
of O
maine O
lobster O
in O
it O
. O

i O
am O
indian O
, O
and O
i O
have O
tried O
many O

try O
the O
pad O
thai O
, O
it's O
fabulous O
and O
their O
prices B
are O
so O
cheap O
! O

on O
a O
recent O
saturday O
night O
, O
i O
was O
with O
a O
group O
of O
<number> O
at O
the O
bread O
bar O
. O

food O
is O
great O
and O
inexpensive O
. O

the O
price B
very O
reasonable O
. O

dessert O
can't O
be O
missed O
, O
so O
save O
room O
! O
! O
! O

it O
can O
be O
a O
little O
confusing O
as O
to O
where O
one O
goes O
to O
order O
, O
but O
once O
the O
food B
is O
ordered O
, O
you O
are O
in O
for O
a O
treat O
. O

take O
a O
good O
sense O
of O
humor O
, O
an O
american O
express O
card O
with O
no O
limit O
, O
walk O
out O
with O
a O
lollipop O
, O
gift O
bag O
in O
hand O
and O
enough O
marketing O
materials O
for O
alain O
to O
to O
take O
the O
show O
on O
the O
road O

ingredients O
are O
organic O
which O
is O
a O
real O
plus O
for O
me O
. O

it O
was O
so O
bad O
i O
actually O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
my O
food B
. O

i O
recommend O
this O
spot O
to O
anyone O
who O
enjoys O
fine O
cuisine B
at O
reasonable O
prices B
. O

this O
is O
, O
by O
far O
, O
my O
favorite O
restaurant O
in O
nyc O
and O
i O
only O
wish O
it O
were O
more O
affordable O
so O
i O
could O
go O
more O
often O
! O

the O
staff B
was O
very O
attentive O
, O
the O
ambience B
lovely O
, O
and O
the O
food B
superb O
. O

i O
love O
when O
restaurants O
think O
using O
fancy O
expensive O
ingrediants B
makes O
the O
food B
fine O
cuisine B
, O
even O
with O
no O
idea O
how O
to O
use O
them O
. O

the O
pizza O
and O
wine B
were O
excellent O
the O
service B
too O
but O
what O
really O
made O
this O
place O
was O
the O
backyard B
dining B
area B
. O

the O
frankenstein O
show O
was O
the O
best O
. O

the O
waiters B
are O
sweet O
, O
the O
food B
is O
tasty O
and O
the O
bill B
is O
never O
too O
large O
. O

as O
a O
fan O
of O
thai O
, O
i O
have O
tried O
quite O
a O
few O
different O
restaurants O
in O
nyc O
and O
this O
one O
was O
definitely O
the O
worst O
. O

the O
service B
was O
superb O
, O
they O
treat O
you O
like O
family O
. O

we O
all O
had O
the O
tasting O
menu B
and O
unlike O
some O
of O
the O
other O
reviews O
, O
i O
felt O
there O
was O
more O
than O
enough O
food B
. O

it O
only O
took O
about O
five O
or O
so O
minutes O
to O
get O
an O
empty O
table B
, O
but O
standing O
up O
wasn't O
too O
bad O
. O

the O
menu B
may O
be O
small O
, O
but O
everything O
on O
it O
is O
delicious O
. O

too O
bad O
latin O
quarters O
closed O
. O

they O
had O
scrapped O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
vessel O
in O
which O
they O
make O
the O
rice B
result O
we O
had O
large O
chunks O
of O
burnt O
rice B
in O
our O
serving O
bowl O
. O

it O
was O
divine O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth O
. O

stumbled O
upon O
this O
gem O
of O
a O
pizza O
place O
and O
i O
will O
be O
going O
back O
frequently O
. O

i O
live O
a O
block O
away O
and O
go O
to O
patsy's O
frequently O
. O

for O
dessert B
we O
split O
chocolate B
cake B
and O
vanilla B
gelato B
with O
espresso O
, O
which O
were O
tasty O
, O
but O
i O
thought O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
. O

when O
i O
visited O
my O
friend O
who O
lives O
in O
the O
upper O
eastside O
, O
she O
recommended O
that O
we O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant O
. O

warm O
, O
comfortable O
surroundings B
, O
nice O
appointments O
witness O
the O
etched O
glass O
and O
brickwork O
separating O
the O
dining B
rooms B
. O

we O
ran O
a O
little O
late O
for O
the O
reservation B
but O
it O
wasn't O
a O
problem O
to O
get O
our O
table B
immediately O
. O

kudos O
haru O

we O
arrived O
on O
time O
for O
our O
reservation B
and O
seated O
promptly O
. O
the O

i O
plan O
on O
eating O
here O
more O
often O
. O

i O
would O
definitely O
go O
back O
for O
a O
very O
special O
occasion O
, O
but O
not O
for O
regular O
fine O
dining B
. O

the O
well O
mannered O
, O
pleasant O
staff B
that O
tony O
has O
in O
his O
employ O
. O

the O
flavors B
robust O
and O
subtle O
. O

i O
came O
here O
for O
my O
friend's O
birthday O
and O
keep O
coming O
back O
ever O
since O
. O

all O
i O
can O
say O
is O
<number> O
pints O
during O
happy O
hour O
and O
the O
some O
of O
the O
cheapest O
oysters B
you'll O
find O
in O
the O
city O
, O
though O
the O
quality B
is O
some O
of O
the O
best O
. O

i O
would O
never O
wait O
for O
a O
table B
to O
eat O
, O
it O
just O
is O
not O
that O
great O
. O

we O
concluded O
with O
tiramisu B
chocolate B
cake B
, O
both O
were O
delicious O
. O

the O
counter B
service B
is O
bad O
. O

i O
had O
a O
grat O
time O
at O
jekyll O
and O
hyde O
! O

service O
here O
was O
great O
, O
food B
was O
fantastic O
. O

its O
a O
little O
out O
of O
the O
way O
if O
you O
don't O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
but O
definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
from O
wherever O
you O
are O
. O

this O
is O
such O
a O
lovely O
, O
peaceful O
place B
to O
eat O
outside O
. O

and O
we O
were O
thouroughly O
disapointed O
. O

this O
is O
the O
jackel O
and O
hideof O
the O
restaurants O
on O
the O
ues O
. O

the O
sauce B
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
crust B
is O
perfect O
. O

this O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
take O
out O
of O
towners O
, O
and O
perfect O
for O
watching O
the O
sunset O
. O

since O
my O
first O
dinner B
i O
have O
had O
the O
chance O
to O
have O
brunch B
at O
orsay O
3x O
. O

you O
will O
pay O
a O
lot O
for O
the O
decore B
, O
but O
the O
food B
is O
no O
better O
or O
worse O
than O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
chinese O
and O
asian O
fusion O
places O
in O
ny O
. O

they O
have O
some O
great O
entrees B
here O
as O
well O
. O

our O
teenage O
kids O
love O
it O
, O
too O
. O

the O
service B
is O
not O
consistently O
excellent O
just O
decent O
. O

the O
food B
, O
served B
in O
small O
tasting O
portions B
as O
an O
option O
is O
very O
good O
with O
each O
dish B
being O
better O
than O
the O
next O
. O

you O
guys O
are O
awesome O
! O

they O
do O
cater B
to O
american O
palates O
, O
but O
if O
you O
like O
it O
hot O
let O
them O
know O
and O
they O
are O
more O
than O
willing O
to O
oblige O
! O

i O
loved O
this O
place O
! O
! O

i O
had O
the O
mango B
chicken B
and O
i O
can't O
go O
on O
to O
tell O
you O
how O
delicious O
that O
was O
and O
the O
presentation B
was O
beatiful O
. O

i O
care O
more O
about O
the O
food B
and O
ambience B
. O

oh O
, O
but O
wait O
, O
we O
were O
out O
of O
drinks B
which O
were O
also O
delightfully O
overpriced O
. O

avoid O
at O
all O
costs O
. O

i O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
everyone O
for O
any O
occasion O
! O

the O
service B
is O
fantastic O
. O

i O
recommend O
that O
you O
try O
this O
hidden O
spot O
which O
will O
surely O
blowup O
very O
soon O

the O
garlic B
mashed B
potatoes B
are O
hands O
down O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city O
! O

food O
and O
service B
was O
okay O
. O

great O
for O
a O
romantic O
evening O
, O
or O
a O
fun O
evening O
with O
friends O
. O
. O
. O

the O
lamb B
meat B
was O
under O
cooked O
and O
extrmely O
chewy O
. O

the O
best O
pad B
thai B
i've O
ever O
had O
. O

over O
time O
, O
the O
food B
quality B
has O
decreased O
substantially O
, O
it O
is O
a O
lot O
less O
crowded O
than O
it O
used O
to O
, O
and O
the O
service B
must O
definitely O
be O
part O
of O
the O
reason O
. O

great O
pizza B
and O
fantastic O
service B
. O

we O
were O
seated O
outside B
and O
the O
waiter B
spilled O
red B
wine B
and O
hot B
tea B
on O
myself O
and O
my O
date O
. O

i O
would O
just O
ask O
for O
no O
oil B
next O
time O
. O

while O
this O
is O
a O
pretty O
place B
in O
that O
overly O
cute O
french O
way O
, O
the O
food B
was O
insultingly O
horrible O
. O

i O
went O
there O
for O
lunch B
and O
it O
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
i O
expected O
from O
the O
reviews O
i O
read O
. O

i O
really O
didn't O
know O
what O
to O
expect O
for O
a O
restaurant O
that O
literally O
overlooks O
the O
main O
hall O
of O
grand O
central O
. O

none O
of O
that O
yucky O
whipped O
stuff O
. O

the O
wine B
list B
isn't O
great O
, O
and O
the O
desserts B
are O
shipped O
in O
from O
bruno's O
down O
the O
street O
, O
which O
is O
not O
as O
good O
as O
it O
used O
to O
be O
. O

i O
ordered O
a O
lassi O
and O
asked O
<number> O
times O
for O
it O
but O
never O
got O
it O
. O

their O
coffee B
is O
quite O
good O
too O
! O

i O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
anyone O
. O

great O
wine B
list B
italian O
, O
good O
food B
, O
service B
was O
initially O
fine O
. O

despite O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
space B
is O
large O
, O
they've O
overcrowded O
the O
floor O
with O
tables B
. O

i O
know O
, O
you O
were O
too O
busy O
showing O
off O
your O
vintage O
tee O
shirt O
and O
looking O
bored O
, O
but O
my O
agenda O
is O
i'm O
here O
to O
eat O
and O
enjoy O
the O
company O
of O
friends O
, O
seeking O
a O
pleasant O
experience O
. O

as O
far O
as O
the O
service B
goes O
, O
the O
waitresses B
were O
not O
particularly O
friendly O
, O
but O
they O
got O
the O
job O
done O
. O

they O
are O
not O
helpful O
in O
the O
least O
and O
will O
give O
you O
the O
grand O
run O
around O
so O
by O
the O
time O
the O
event O
date O
rolls O
around O
you O
will O
not O
only O
regret O
chosing O
this O
place B
, O
but O
also O
become O
hostile O
! O

i O
had O
to O
ask O
her O
three O
times O
before O
she O
finally O
came O
back O
with O
the O
dish B
ive O
requested O
. O

normally O
that O
would O
be O
improper O
, O
however O
they O
were O
all O
delicious O
and O
my O
host B
did O
not O
complain O
. O

taxan O
delicious O
! O

perhaps O
it O
was O
an O
off O
night O
, O
but O
it O
was O
suprisingly O
average O
for O
a O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
rating O
. O

unlike O
other O
places O
in O
nyc O
where O
the O
sandwiches B
you O
want O
only O
come O
as O
a O
triple O
decker O
, O
here O
you O
can O
get O
what O
you O
want O
in O
a O
reasonably O
sized O
portion B
and O
price B
. O

southern O
indian O
cuisine B
is O
still O
there O
, O
too O
. O

restaurant O
snobs O
need O
not O
bother O
, O
this O
is O
a O
small O
, O
neighborhood O
kind O
of O
place B
. O

have O
been O
dozens O
of O
times O
and O
never O
failed O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
. O

they O
couldn't O
even O
make O
a O
salad B
that O
was O
appealing O
. O

for O
two O
people O
with O
tip B
was O
less O
than O
<number> O
bucks O
. O

killer O
sushi O
! O

of O
course O
the O
reason O
its O
so O
packed O
is O
because O
the O
food B
is O
so O
delicious O
! O

staffs O
are O
not O
that O
friendly O
, O
but O
the O
taste B
covers O
all O
. O

the O
jukebox B
plays O
everything O
from O
italian O
opera O
to O
the O
strokes O
. O

and O
i've O
been O
to O
many O
nyc O
delis O
. O

this O
place O
is O
always O
packed O
. O

much O
of O
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
you O
. O

plus O
they O
made O
a O
perfect O
martini B
. O

i O
am O
not O
sure O
if O
i O
would O
call O
the O
food B
here O
indian O
as O
it O
is O
a O
fusion O
of O
what O
seems O
to O
be O
french O
with O
an O
indian O
or O
exotic O
touch O
. O

i've O
eaten O
thai O
many O
times O
, O
and O
am O
very O
familiar O
with O
the O
cuisine B
. O

the O
waiter B
was O
attentive O
. O

their O
margarita O
is O
best O
i've O
had O
since O
i've O
returned O
from O
naples O
! O

i O
highly O
recommend O
the O
restaurant O
based O
on O
our O
experience O
last O
night O
. O

the O
tastes B
makes O
your O
mouth O
water O
for O
more O
. O

i O
came O
into O
the O
city O
to O
try O
out O
this O
restaurant O
because O
a O
friend O
had O
recommended O
it O
to O
my O
husband O
. O

their O
sake B
list B
was O
extensive O
, O
but O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
purple O
haze O
, O
which O
wasn't O
listed O
but O
made O
for O
us O
upon O
request O
! O

the O
tables B
are O
crammed O
way O
too O
close O
, O
the O
menu B
is O
typical O
of O
any O
italian O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
wine B
list B
is O
simply O
overpriced O
. O

all O
in O
all O
a O
wonderful O
experience O
, O
can't O
wait O
to O
come O
back O
. O

the O
food B
was O
actually O
aweful O
. O

after O
dining O
at O
b O
. O
o O
. O
g O
over O
twenty O
times O
now O
, O
its O
official O
! O

they O
are O
served B
with O
a O
free O
appetizer B
and O
the O
portions B
are O
perfect O
for O
lunch B
. O

there O
is O
actually O
space B
to O
breathe O
and O
the O
decor B
sets O
the O
tone O
for O
an O
intimate O
dinner B
. O

we O
went O
around O
<number> O
<number> O
on O
a O
friday O
and O
it O
had O
died O
down O
a O
bit O
by O
then O
so O
the O
service B
was O
great O
! O

my O
husband O
and O
i O
both O
ordered O
the O
steak O
, O
medium O
. O

furthermore O
, O
the O
rice B
had O
no O
seasoning B
, O
so O
the O
sushi B
was O
bland O
and O
disgusting O
. O

this O
place O
has O
realy O
fresh O
sushi B
and O
a O
nice O
large O
menu B
of O
japanese O
classic B
cuisine B
. O

the O
sushi B
is O
average O
and O
the O
prices B
are O
anything O
but O
. O

my O
wife O
and O
i O
also O
enjoyed O
the O
spinach B
, O
the O
shanghai O
low B
mein B
, O
and O
other O
attractions O
. O

owner O
must O
have O
coem O
on O
this O
website O
to O
give O
himself O
credit O
. O

turned O
out O
there O
was O
full O
service B
upstairs O
and O
sat O
down O
. O

i O
would O
go O
back O
. O

definitely O
will O
be O
back O
! O

several O
of O
the O
dim B
sum B
orders B
had O
about O
<number> O
<number> O
pieces O
. O

i'm O
not O
sure O
why O
these O
other O
reviewers O
are O
whining O
so O
much O
. O

they O
live O
up O
to O
the O
thai O
way O
of O
living O
. O

if O
you O
have O
a O
dumpling B
fetish O
i O
suggest O
you O
try O
some O
here O
! O

three O
page O
wine B
menu B
, O
one O
page O
entree B
and O
horedevous B
. O

the O
food B
is O
consistently O
wonderful O
i've O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
years O
, O
and O
the O
owner B
has O
always O
been O
accomodating O
and O
friendly O
. O

the O
waiters B
and O
owners B
were O
nonchalant O
about O
this O
and O
promised O
to O
call O
the O
exterminator O
but O
weren't O
as O
dismayed O
or O
apologetic O
as O
i O
would O
have O
expected O
. O

i O
live O
nearby O
and O
when O
they O
first O
opened O
, O
i O
ate O
there O
a O
lot O
. O

and O
the O
food B
was O
fantastic O
. O

this O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
you'd O
like O
to O
take O
all O
your O
friends O
to O
and O
still O
keep O
a O
secret O
. O

if O
you're O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
to O
sit O
down O
, O
have O
a O
drink B
and O
conversations O
with B
friends O
, O
go O
to O
sweet O
n O
tart O
and O
order O
yourself O
a O
hong O
kong O
styled B
milk B
and O
tea B
with B
tapioca B
pearls B
hot O
. O

aside O
from O
the O
sea O
urchin O
, O
the O
chef B
recommended O
an O
assortment B
of B
fish B
including O
fatty O
yellow O
tail O
, O
boton O
shrimp O
, O
blue O
fin O
torro O
fatty O
tuna O
, O
sea O
eel O
, O
etc O
. O

they're O
also O
friendlier O
here O
, O
especially O
the O
owner B
, O
kenny O
. O

while O
the O
room B
is O
not O
particularly O
comfortable O
, O
once O
you're O
seated O
you'll O
forget O
about O
everything O
except O
what's O
on O
your O
plate B
. O

i've O
lived O
in O
nyc O
all O
my O
life O
and O
had O
never O
before O
seen O
so O
many O
waterbugs B
in O
one O
place O
except O
in O
a O
really O
bad O
dream O
. O

winnie O
and O
her O
staff B
are O
the O
best O
crew B
you O
can O
find O
serving B
you O
. O

the O
ambiance B
is O
minimal O
the O
food B
is O
not O
phenomenal O
, O
but O
some O
dishes B
are O
quite O
good O
, O
such O
as O
the O
eggplant B
parmesan B
, O
veal B
in B
carozza B
chicken B
saltimbocca B
. O

my O
host B
asked O
for O
appetizers B
for O
the O
group O
and O
the O
waiter B
gave O
us O
not O
only O
what O
we O
ordered O
, O
but O
some O
other O
items O
that O
were O
not O
ordered O
. O

you O
can O
even O
get O
packages O
of O
the O
chutneys B
to O
stock O
your O
fridge O
! O

the O
bar B
has O
various O
selections O
and O
the O
mixed B
drink B
special B
is O
a O
catcher O
! O
<number> O
for O
1's O
. O

slightly O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
but O
worth O
it O
! O

if O
it O
isn't O
for O
the O
food B
a O
, O
it O
must O
be O
the O
service B
or O
the O
ambience B
. O

during O
the O
course O
of O
the O
past O
<number> O
months O
, O
the O
chef B
and O
staff B
changed O
and O
it O
was O
not O
for O
the O
better O
. O

i O
like O
the O
ambience B
, O
it's O
very O
dark O
and O
original O
. O

not O
the O
typical O
nyc O
gimmick O
theme O
restaurant O
. O

we O
were O
exploring O
grand O
central O
and O
didn't O
want O
to O
eat O
in O
the O
food O
court O
. O

overall O
, O
not O
worth O
the O
money B
. O

this O
place O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
prices B
. O

we O
left O
after O
one O
drink B
. O

everything O
that O
happened O
was O
not O
even O
up O
to O
mediocre O
. O

our O
last O
time O
there O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
was O
early O
at O
5pm O
and O
it O
was O
very O
crowded O
and O
noisy O
. O

pick O
a O
bagel O
has O
the O
best O
bagels B
in O
the O
city O
. O

you O
are O
paying O
for O
the O
atmosphere B
, O
which O
is O
nice O
, O
but O
can O
be O
had O
in O
numerous O
places O
in O
bay O
ridge O
. O

it's O
called O
gnochi O
alla O
nona O
and O
is O
found O
under O
chef O
specials O
. O

it O
is O
one O
the O
nicest O
outdoor O
restaurants O
i O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
ny O
i O
am O
from O
italy O
and O
this O
place O
rivals O
the O
ones O
in O
my O
country O
. O

yes O
you O
have O
to O
wait B
to O
be O
seated O
and O
because O
its O
small O
there O
is O
no O
waiting B
area B
and O
the O
seat B
at O
the O
bar B
was O
all O
taken O
. O

the O
last O
two O
times O
i O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
i O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
the O
spice B
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor B
of O
the O
dish B
. O

the O
fried B
dumplings B
are O
great O
! O

this O
place O
has O
the O
best O
chinese O
style O
bbq O
ribs B
in O
the O
city O
. O

ive O
been O
here O
so O
many O
times O
the O
waiters B
know O
my O
name O
. O

the O
decor B
is O
very O
simple O
but O
comfortable O
. O

i've O
been O
frequenting O
the O
tasting O
room O
since O
it O
first O
arrived O
in O
the O
east O
village O
and O
i've O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

we O
figured O
we O
never O
had O
argentinian O
pizza B
before O
so O
we O
grabbed O
our O
lunch B
there O
, O
sharing O
a O
large O
pelligrino O
, O
a O
pizza B
of O
two O
of O
their O
specials O
, O
one O
was O
goat B
cheese B
the O
other O
blue B
cheese B
, O
and O
both O
were O
excellent O
. O

heartland O
brewery O
is O
a O
great O
way O
to O
start O
or O
finish O
your O
day O
. O

the O
'kamasutra' O
and O
'bombay O
cosmopolitan' O
are O
excellent O
and O
will O
have O
you O
tipsy O
in O
no O
time O
. O

this O
is O
the O
perfect O
date B
spot B
for O
williamsburg O
couples O
. O

the O
dim B
sum B
here O
is O
only O
so O
so O
. O

it O
was O
raining O
, O
and O
we O
figured O
why O
not O
? O

<number> O
and O
there O
is O
much O
tasty O
food B
, O
all O
of O
it O
fresh O
and O
continually O
refilled O
. O

just O
straight O
up O
cheap O
, O
good O
food B
. O

another O
welcome O
addition O
to O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

seating O
is O
ok O
even O
though O
sometimes O
there's O
alot O
of O
people O
. O

this O
time O
, O
i O
prefer O
not O
to O
go O
into O
detail O
. O

even O
with O
a O
relatively O
inexpensive O
botle B
of B
wine B
, O
if O
you O
can O
call O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
inexpensive O
, O
the O
cost B
is O
through O
the O
roof O
for O
better O
than O
average O
fare O
. O

service O
was O
slow O
, O
but O
the O
people B
were O
friendly O
. O

steamed O
fresh O
so O
brought O
hot O
hot O
hot O
to O
your O
table O
. O

the O
steak B
was O
very O
fatty O
and O
the O
sauce B
was O
overpowering O
and O
not O
very O
tasty O
. O

my O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
you O
are O
literally O
sitting O
on O
top O
of O
the O
people O
next O
to O
you O
! O

and O
affordable O
. O

the O
staff B
makes O
you O
feel O
at O
home O
, O
the O
food B
is O
great O
and O
the O
atmosphere B
is O
wonderful O
! O

i O
actually O
feel O
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret O
. O

the O
food B
is O
alright O
some O
stuff O
is O
good O
some O
is O
not O
like O
the O
steak B
dish B
which O
tends O
to O
be O
dry O
. O

not O
only O
would O
i O
not O
recommend O
jimmy's O
restaurants O
to O
friends O
, O
i O
would O
strongly O
suggest O
they O
go O
anywhere O
but O
. O

they O
have O
a O
very O
diverse O
menu B
so O
its O
something O
for O
everybody O
. O

haru O
on O
park O
s O
is O
simply O
disgusting O
. O

the O
staff B
was O
too O
busy O
ordering O
sushi B
for O
dinner B
and O
then O
laying O
it O
out O
to O
eat O
on O
the O
bar B
to O
even O
bring O
me O
my O
check B
. O

as O
a O
long O
time O
patron O
of O
mamoun's O
, O
i O
always O
figured O
that O
i O
had O
found O
the O
best O
late O
night O
food B
spot B
in O
the O
city O
. O

i O
drop O
more O
dollar O
bills O
here O
than O
your O
uncle O
after O
a O
weekend O
at O
scores O
. O

the O
bagel B
was O
huge O
. O

go O
there O
to O
relax O
and O
feel O
like O
your O
somewhere O
else O
. O

get O
the O
tuna B
of O
gari O
. O

i O
like O
the O
somosas B
, O
chai B
, O
and O
the O
chole B
, O
but O
the O
dhosas B
and O
dhal B
were O
kinda O
dissapointing O
. O

it O
was O
a O
very O
nice O
surprise O
. O

edible O
but O
really O
a O
ripoff O
at O
those O
prices B
given O
whats O
in O
the O
area O
. O

the O
staff B
has O
been O
nice O
, O
but O
they O
seemed O
really O
stressed O
and O
the O
unisex O
bathroom B
needs O
to O
be O
cleaned O
more O
often O
. O

i O
am O
french O
and O
i O
really O
felt O
like O
home O
! O
! O
! O

i O
have O
been O
to O
casimir O
over O
<number> O
times O
and O
i O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
time O
there O
. O

the O
service B
was O
the O
only O
thing O
good O
about O
this O
restaurant O
. O

it's O
usually O
packed O
for O
good O
reason O
, O
esp O
. O

service O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

i O
love O
going O
there O
! O

i O
cannot O
recommend O
og O
more O
highly O
if O
i O
tried O
check O
it O
out O
for O
yourself O
. O

it O
was O
the O
first O
place O
we O
ate O
on O
our O
first O
trip O
to O
new O
york O
, O
and O
it O
will O
be O
the O
last O
place O
we O
stop O
as O
we O
head O
out O
of O
town O
on O
our O
next O
trip O
to O
new O
york O
. O

service O
was O
very O
prompt O
but O
slightly O
rushed O
. O

great O
food B
, O
great O
decor B
, O
great O
service B
. O

and O
, O
atlhough O
tables B
opened O
up O
next O
to O
us O
and O
we O
asked O
for O
a O
slightly O
larger O
space B
, O
they O
left O
us O
awkardly O
seated O
. O

the O
palak B
paneer B
was O
standard O
, O
and O
i O
was O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
the O
malai B
kofta B
. O

i've O
dined O
at O
alain O
ducasse's O
restaurant O
in O
monte O
carlo O
for O
half O
the O
price B
for O
the O
same O
excellent O
dining B
experience O
. O

yeah O
, O
sometimes O
the O
service B
can O
be O
slow O
. O

there O
was O
no O
ambiance B
. O

save O
your O
money O
and O
don't O
waste O
your O
calories O
, O
go O
to O
margharita's O
on O
washington O
street O
instead O
, O
they O
have O
amazing O
food B
and O
the O
best O
service B
. O

the O
service B
was O
attentive O
without O
being O
overbearing O
and O
each O
dish B
we O
tried O
was O
wonderful O
from O
the O
spring B
rolls B
to O
the O
cod B
with B
pineapple B
tempura B
. O

but O
trust O
me O
it O
is O
so O
worth O
it O
. O

it O
is O
not O
a O
place O
for O
tourists O
or O
someone O
who O
has O
never O
dined O
in O
bay O
ridge O
. O

the O
perfect O
spot O
. O

the O
only O
weird O
thing O
was O
if O
we O
got O
a O
bottle B
, O
the O
waitress B
would O
have O
simply O
multiplied O
the O
glass O
price B
x4 O
, O
which O
makes O
no O
sense O
whatsoever O
. O

they O
sell O
special O
sushi B
, O
everything O
have O
a O
topping B
, O
sauce B
and O
etc O
. O

do O
not O
try O
unless O
you're O
just O
going O
there O
to O
hang O
out O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
hipsters O
who O
apparently O
have O
no O
sense O
of O
taste B
. O

they O
never O
came O
back O
to O
refill O
our O
glasses O
again O
. O

the O
place B
is O
small O
and O
intimate O
and O
you O
may O
feel O
a O
little O
crowded O
, O
but O
the O
service B
is O
excellent O
and O
it's O
great O
for O
friends O
out O
, O
a O
romantic O
date O
, O
or O
a O
special O
occassion O
. O

the O
service B
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
food B
was O
delicious O
. O

service O
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

i O
took O
my O
girlfriend O
there O
for O
her O
birthday O
last O
night O
and O
we O
had O
a O
relaxing O
, O
really O
good O
meal B
. O

i O
would O
not O
have O
been O
so O
disappointed O
with O
the O
portions B
if O
the O
qualities B
were O
good O
enough O
to O
make O
up O
for O
it O
, O
but O
they O
were O
not O
! O

they're O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
and O
not O
very O
friendly O
. O

i'm O
happy O
to O
have O
nosh O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
the O
food B
is O
very O
comforting O
. O

good O
atmosphere B
, O
combination O
of O
all O
the O
hottest O
music B
dress B
code O
is O
relatively O
strict O
except O
on O
fridays O
. O

they O
kindly O
brought O
us O
more O
to O
see O
if O
it O
was O
better O
, O
but O
it O
was O
not O
! O

love O
the O
food B
. O

i O
would O
highly O
recommend O
nina's O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
to O
have O
a O
romantic O
dinner B
in O
a O
heart O
warming O
surrounding B
filled O
with O
candles B
and O
family O
pictures B
. O

all O
the O
desserts B
the O
group O
tried O
got O
favorable O
reviews O
. O

there's O
something O
smooth O
about O
sipping O
sake B
upper O
east O
side O
style O
. O

it's O
a O
nice O
place B
to O
relax O
and O
have O
conversation O
. O

this O
place O
has O
got O
to O
be O
the O
best O
japanese O
restaurant O
in O
the O
new O
york O
area O
. O

best O
reuben O
sandwich B
ever O
! O

lucky O
strike O
is O
a O
great O
casual O
place B
to O
just O
grab O
a O
bite O
to O
eat O
. O

wonderful O
strawberry B
daiquiries B
as O
well O
! O

going O
to O
volare O
is O
like O
going O
to O
your O
favorite O
aunt's O
house O
for O
dinner B
, O
assuming O
that O
your O
aunt O
is O
a O
great O
italian O
cook O
. O

the O
sushi B
has O
been O
from O
average O
to O
below O
average O
, O
the O
wait B
service B
has O
always O
been O
sub O
par O
the O
atmosphere B
goes O
from O
nice O
to O
really O
irritating O
if O
you O
sit O
in O
the O
area B
beyond O
the O
kitchen O
, O
the O
acousitcs O
are O
horrid O
, O
everything O
echoes O
is O
extremely O
loud O
. O

i O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
go O
again O
. O

frites O
were O
delicious O
if O
a O
bit O
on O
the O
thick O
side O
. O

so O
so O
so O
so O
so O
good O
! O

alone O
for O
<number> O
bucks O
, O
it O
is O
really O
overprice O
. O

out O
of O
the O
hundreds O
of O
italian O
restaurants O
in O
queens O
, O
this O
is O
among O
the O
best O
. O

very O
good O
value O

here O
you O
get O
the O
zen B
feel B
without O
feeling O
rigid O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
putting O
your O
name O
down O
and O
then O
getting O
a O
drink B
at O
a O
local O
bar B
first O
though O
because O
of O
the O
wait B
time B
. O

i O
fell O
in B
love O
with B
the B
egg B
noodles B
in B
the B
beef B
broth B
with B
shrimp B
dumplings B
and B
slices B
of B
bbq O
roast B
pork B
. O

i O
keep O
my O
fingers O
crossed O
the O
whole O
subway O
ride O
hoping O
that O
there O
will O
be O
a O
table B
i O
can O
sit O
at O
by O
myself O
and O
not O
have O
to O
share O
with O
the O
rice B
congee B
soup B
people O
. O

overall O
, O
the O
best O
bagel B
in O
town O
. O

everything O
a O
ny O
pizza O
joint O
should O
be O
. O

it O
was O
huge O
, O
delicious O
, O
fresh O
, O
and O
will O
be O
the O
reason O
we O
return O
. O

we O
go O
often O
. O

light O
, O
refreshing O
summer B
rolls B
not O
fried O
remind O
me O
of O
vietnamese O
places O
in O
paris O
. O

the O
sushi B
seemed O
pretty O
fresh O
and O
was O
adequately O
proportioned O
. O

moral O
stay O
away O
. O

but O
the O
service B
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
. O

spreads O
and O
toppings B
are O
great O
though O
a O
bit O
pricey O
. O

when O
i O
saw O
that O
their O
website O
had O
a O
link O
to O
da O
ciro O
in O
napoli O
, O
i O
knew O
there O
was O
going O
to O
be O
good O
pizza B
! O

no O
one O
asked O
what O
was O
wrong O
as O
we O
left O
with O
nothing O
touched O
on O
our O
plates B
. O

indoor O
was O
very O
cozy O
and O
cute O
. O

we O
had O
a O
<number> O
hour O
brunch B
they O
definitely O
do O
not O
rush O
you O
and O
they O
kept O
the O
unlimited O
mimosas B
flowing O
the O
whole O
time O
. O

and O
their O
prices B
are O
very O
high O
they O
actually O
think O
that O
they O
can O
get O
away O
with O
charging O
such O
prices B
for O
such O
terrible O
food B
and O
service B
! O

they're O
terrific O
! O
! O

the O
service B
was O
excellent O
, O
the O
food B
was O
excellent O
, O
but O
the O
entire O
experience O
was O
very O
cool O
. O

the O
service B
is O
good O
and O
the O
resturant O
is O
clean O
. O

great O
spot B
, O
whether O
looking O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
drinks B
or O
quiet O
dinner B
. O

just O
stick O
with O
the O
small O
dishes B
! O

the O
cafe B
itself O
was O
really O
nice O
with O
comfortable O
outdoor B
chairs B
and O
tables B
, O
but O
the O
service B
could O
have O
been O
better O
. O

i've O
rarely O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
slow O
staff B
in O
the O
<number> O
years O
i've O
been O
going O
. O

food O
is O
excellent O
. O

this O
place O
is O
a O
literal O
hole O
in O
the O
wall O
that O
is O
buried O
within O
doyers O
, O
right O
off O
of O
pell O
st O
barber's O
alley O
in O
chinatown O
. O

they O
outshine O
hh O
. O

although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular O
lettuce B
and O
some O
walnuts B
the O
salads B
we O
got O
were O
great O
. O

excellent O
lunch B
buffet B
for O
only O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
. O

we O
were O
sorry O
to O
check O
them O
off O
our O
list O
as O
we O
had O
enjoyed O
and O
recommended O
the O
place O
in O
the O
past O
. O

if O
you're O
not O
familiar O
with O
the O
cuisine B
, O
you O
may O
encounter O
problems O
ordering O
here O
and O
be O
sure O
to O
bring O
plenty O
of O
cash O
with O
you O
as O
they O
don't O
accept O
credit O
cards O
. O

both O
are O
very O
reasonably O
priced B
around O
<number> O
for O
dinner B
and O
<number> O
for O
lunch B
, O
and O
are O
delicious O
and O
filling O
. O

problem O
is O
nothing O
at O
prune O
is O
particularly O
memorable O
. O

ambience O
is O
so O
cute O
and O
quaint O
, O
good O
for O
business O
although O
we O
were O
there O
on O
vacation O
. O

the O
portion B
sizes B
here O
are O
huge O
, O
and O
the O
sushi B
is O
good O
. O

just O
wish O
they'd O
expand O
. O

my O
boyfriend O
ate O
tuna B
and O
it O
was O
cooked O
perfectly O
! O

this O
wasn't O
the O
expected O
menu B
comprised O
only O
of O
pad B
thai B
and O
tom B
yum B
soup B
, O
but O
i O
thought O
that O
was O
what O
made O
the O
place O
so O
special O
. O

good O
food B
at O
the O
restaurant O
a O
bit O
expensive O
, O
but O
great O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
your O
date O
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
caviar B
russe O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
delicious O
top O
grade O
caviar B
and O
fantastic O
service B
. O

you O
can't O
say O
its O
cheap O
because O
food B
is O
cheaper O
in O
chinatown O
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
there O
<number> O
<number> O
times O
and O
the O
food B
was O
always O
good O
. O

keep O
up O
the O
good O
work O
. O

i O
wasn't O
thrilled O
to O
have O
to O
wait B
on O
line O
for O
thirty O
minutes O
, O
but O
i O
guess O
that's O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
popular O
place O
. O

great O
eats B
, O
good O
times O
. O

make O
sure O
you O
try O
this O
place O
as O
often O
as O
you O
can O
. O

grilled O
whole O
fish B
wonderful O
, O
great O
spicing O
. O

for O
years O
, O
i O
thought O
tuscan O
cuisine B
was O
the O
best O
, O
but O
salvatore O
converted O
me O
to O
the O
hearty O
neapolitan O
fare B
on O
my O
first O
visit O
. O

plus O
, O
when O
our O
entrees B
were O
held O
up O
in O
the O
kitchen O
on O
a O
busy O
saturday O
night O
, O
the O
owner B
sent O
over O
complimentary O
summer B
rolls B
to O
hold O
us O
over O
! O

the O
service B
was O
great O
as O
well O
. O

try O
the O
lobster B
teriyaki B
and O
the O
rose B
special B
roll B
. O

another O
plus O
is O
most O
of O
the O
entrees B
are O
approx O
. O

i O
will O
go O
back O
to O
suan O
soon O
! O

loved O
it O
! O

the O
food B
was O
delicious O
, O
the O
atmosphere B
was O
relaxed O
, O
and O
we O
have O
now O
adopted O
plate O
<number> O
as O
our O
secret O
on O
second O
! O

we O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

from O
the O
moment O
we O
walked O
in O
they O
were O
more O
than O
accomodating O
even O
though O
the O
place B
was O
packed O
. O

it O
is O
loud O
, O
hot O
and O
dark O
. O

i O
found O
the O
food B
, O
service B
and O
value B
exceptional O
everytime O
i O
have O
been O
there O
. O

we O
ate O
at O
this O
thai O
place O
following O
the O
reviews O
but O
very O
unhappy O
with O
the O
foods B
. O

the O
food B
is O
definitely O
good O
, O
but O
i O
left O
a O
bit O
disappointed O
. O

i O
am O
a O
<number> O
lb O
girl O
, O
had O
a O
glass B
of B
wine B
and O
a O
glass B
of B
beer B
prior O
to O
the O
dinner B
, O
and O
i O
was O
still O
hungry O
after O
my O
visit O
to O
this O
place O
! O

the O
drinks B
are O
a O
saving O
grace O
, O
but O
service B
staff B
, O
please O
, O
get O
over O
yourselves O
. O

it O
was O
wonderful O
. O

there O
is O
a O
downside O
if O
you're O
ordering O
in O
the O
delivery B
guys B
have O
major O
attitude O
. O

will O
give O
it O
another O
chance O
before O
i O
write O
it O
off O
. O

the O
all O
italian O
staff B
is O
warm O
and O
engaging O
from O
the O
start O
. O

village O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
scores O
on O
all O
fronts O
. O

the O
prices B
are O
exceptionally O
reasonable O
for O
food B
of O
this O
caliber O
. O

if O
you O
go O
here O
your O
focus O
should O
be O
the O
tamarind O
margaritas O
. O

it O
is O
the O
best O
hidden O
spot O
there O
and O
i O
rave O
about O
it O
to O
everyone O
. O

the O
filet B
mignon B
dish B
was O
superb O
! O

i O
had O
been O
a B
regular O
due O
to O
the O
consistently O
good O
food B
and O
ease O
of O
getting B
a B
table B
. O

can't O
wait O
wait O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

this O
place B
is O
the O
most O
japanese O
it O
can O
ever O
get O
. O

the O
food B
is O
good O
, O
i O
can't O
lie O
. O

great O
food B
, O
lt's O
of O
it O
, O
more O
then O
one O
person O
can O
eat O
! O

i O
didn't O
expect O
to O
like O
nosh O
as O
much O
as O
i O
did O
, O
but O
the O
pastrami B
on B
challah B
sandwich B
i O
had O
was O
otherworldly O
, O
the O
soups B
are O
like O
mom's O
, O
and O
the O
knishes B
give O
yonah O
schimmel's O
a O
run O
for O
its O
money O
. O

the O
atmosphere B
is O
nothing O
special O
, O
but O
it O
feels O
like O
a O
sushi O
establishment O
in O
tokyo O
. O

cozy O
romantic O
atomosphere B
with O
only O
around O
<number> O
tables B
at O
most O
. O

this O
place O
is O
worth O
going O
even O
if O
only O
for O
their O
beer B
. O

i O
really O
like O
both O
the O
scallops B
and O
the O
mahi B
mahi B
on O
saffron B
risotto B
yum O
! O
. O

the O
ambience B
was O
so O
fun O
, O
and O
the O
prices B
were O
great O
, O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food B
was O
really O
tasty O
. O

do O
not O
get O
the O
go O
go O
hamburgers O
, O
no O
matter O
what O
the O
reviews O
say O
. O

the O
sandwhiches B
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
! O

if O
you O
live O
in O
upper O
manhattan O
, O
siam O
square O
is O
the O
place O
for O
thia O
food B
. O

decor O
is O
charming O
. O

the O
food B
was O
very O
well O
prepared O
. O

really O
tasty O
spring B
rolls B
and O
noodles B
for O
a O
good O
price B
though O
. O

stay O
away O
from O
this O
place O
. O

good O
, O
because O
hey O
, O
it's O
more O
food B
, O
but O
bad O
because O
dim B
sum B
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
smaller O
portions B
so O
you O
can O
try O
out O
more O
dishes B
and O
smaller O
so O
that O
each O
dish B
is O
cheap O
. O

while O
most O
people O
can O
attest O
to O
spending O
over O
<number> O
on O
drinks B
in O
new O
york O
bars B
and O
hardly O
feeling O
a O
thing O
, O
the O
drinks B
here O
are O
plentiful O
and O
unique O
. O

complimentary O
stuff B
kept O
coming O
, O
and O
when O
the O
waiter B
saw O
me O
opening O
a O
gift O
, O
i O
received O
my O
dessert B
on O
a O
plate O
that O
had O
happy O
birthday O
written O
on O
it O
, O
with O
a O
candlevery O
nice O
touch O
, O
and O
attentive O
staff B
. O

the O
food B
arrived O
<number> O
minutes O
after O
i O
called O
, O
cold O
and O
soggy O
. O

if O
you O
go O
for O
the O
pre O
theatre O
menu B
, O
it's O
an O
even O
greater O
deal O
. O

the O
one O
up O
front O
will O
smile O
and O
say O
what O
can O
i O
get O
for O
you O
, O
brother O
? O

brava O
la O
pizza O

and O
wonderfully O
presented O
and O
tasting O
seafood B
and O
vegetables B
regardless O
of O
portion B
size B
, O
kai O
is O
your O
place O
. O

the O
prices B
cannot O
be O
beat O
for O
the O
quality B
, O
quantity B
, O
freshness B
and O
taste B
. O

check O
it O
out O
, O
it O
won't O
hurt O
your O
stomach B
or O
your O
wallet B
. O

little O
tonino's O
is O
just O
awesome O
, O
our O
favorite O
delivery O
place O
in O
kennsington O
, O
honestly O
the O
best O
gnochi O
i O
have O
ever O
had O
! O

incredibly O
poor O
service O
an O
food O
quality O
at O
exorbitant O
prices O
. O

i O
have O
been O
about O
<number> O
times O
and O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
meal B
. O

i O
go O
back O
in O
line B
like O
three O
times O
on O
average O
until O
i O
can't O
walk O
anymore O
. O

we O
usually O
just O
get O
some O
of O
the O
dinner B
specials B
and O
they O
are O
very O
reasonably O
priced B
and O
very O
tasty O
. O

horrible O
food B
and O
horrible O
service B
. O

the O
wine B
and O
cheese B
plate O
are O
plentiful O
and O
can't O
wait O
to O
try O
the O
fondue B
or O
table B
grilling B
. O

bleecker O
st O
pizza O
is O
the O
best O
! O

i O
do O
not O
recommend O
the O
heartland O
brewery O
. O

they O
treated O
us O
well O
and O
the O
food B
was O
extremely O
fresh O
and O
well O
prepared O
. O

their O
exotic B
salad B
is O
basic O
ly O
a O
delcious O
little O
green B
salad B
with O
a O
peanut B
sauce B
that O
is O
perfect O
before O
their O
sweet B
basil B
fried B
tofu B
. O

the O
big O
complaint O
no O
toasting O
available O
. O

even O
if O
the O
food B
wasn't O
this O
good O
, O
the O
garden B
is O
a O
great O
place B
to O
sit O
outside O
and O
relax O
. O

volare O
virgins O
or O
weekly O
regulars O
, O
everyone O
gets O
treated O
the O
same O
and O
you O
can't O
ask O
for O
more O
than O
that O
when O
the O
service B
is O
this O
friendly O
. O

the O
food B
came O
out O
wrong O
, O
the O
waiter B
was O
no O
where O
to O
be O
found O
and O
the O
wine B
showed O
up O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal B
. O

the O
chicken B
and O
steak B
were O
seasoned O
and O
cooked O
to O
perfection O
, O
and O
the O
lamb B
sandwhich B
is O
great O
for O
heartier O
appetites O
. O

faan O
is O
sooo O
good O
. O

we O
saw O
them O
heating O
up O
at O
least O
one O
frozen O
item O
though O
i'm O
not O
sure O
which O
dim B
sum B
dish B
it O
was O
. O

no O
you're O
going O
to O
go O
back O
because O
the O
food B
was O
good O
. O

the O
food B
was O
great O
and O
the O
service B
was O
even O
better O
. O

while O
this O
can O
hardly O
be O
called O
a O
restaurant O
, O
it O
is O
possibly O
the O
best O
deal O
in O
manhatten O
<number> O
for O
a O
plate O
heaped O
with O
rice B
and O
<number> O
<number> O
entrees B
. O

traditional O
french O
decour B
was O
pleasant O
though O
the O
hall B
was O
rather O
noisy O
the O
restaurant O
was O
full O
and O
we O
had O
to O
raise O
our O
voices O
to O
be O
able O
to O
maintain O
a O
conversation O
. O

the O
fish B
is O
fresh O
and O
each O
piece O
is O
sliced O
to O
perfection O
and O
seasoned O
by O
the O
sushi B
chef B
usually O
with O
a O
little O
fresh O
wasabi B
and O
soy B
sauce B
but O
also O
sometimes O
with O
some O
sea B
salt B
. O

consequently O
, O
their O
burgers B
fell O
apart O
in O
their O
hands O
and O
made O
such O
a O
mess O
that O
they O
did'nt O
feel O
like O
finishing O
them O
. O

my O
son O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
both O
wanted O
cheeseburgers B
and O
they O
were O
huge O
! O

i O
really O
recommend O
the O
very O
simple O
unda O
egg O
rolls B
. O

i O
will O
not O
be O
coming O
here O
at O
3am O
again O
. O

unbelievable O
. O

very O
good O
wine B
choices B
. O

this O
is O
the O
only O
thai O
place O
i O
go O
too O
in O
nyc O
, O
it's O
wonderful O
, O
and O
live O
relaxed O
jazz O
on O
certain O
nights O
. O

we O
will O
be O
back O
. O

we O
were O
seated O
and O
ignored O
by O
waitstaff B
. O

if O
you O
are O
in O
a O
big O
group O
, O
this O
place O
is O
perfect O
because O
it O
recomends O
sharing O
they O
have O
lazy B
susans B
on O
most O
tables B
even O
families O
can O
feel O
comfortable O
here O
. O

they O
showed O
up O
<number> O
minutes O
after O
the O
tuna B
melt O
. O

tasty O
steak B
, O
pork B
loin B
, O
the O
works O
. O

i O
went O
with O
<number> O
friends O
and O
we O
lingered O
at O
the O
table B
for O
a O
bit O
and O
didn't O
feel O
rushed O
at O
all O
even O
though O
there O
was O
a O
wait B
. O

i O
went O
to O
ruby O
foos O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
enjoyed O
our O
experience O
there O
. O

i'd O
highly O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
it O
provides O
and O
intimate O
setting B
and O
nice O
service B
. O

the O
burger B
was O
great O
, O
also O
. O

they O
did O
give O
a O
<number> O
discount B
at O
the O
end O
, O
wasn't O
enough O
, O
as O
they O
knew O
the O
service B
was O
horrible O
. O

just O
because O
it's O
cheap O
does O
not O
mean O
the O
portions B
are O
small O
or O
the O
food B
is O
nasty O
, O
it O
is O
great O
! O

the O
pizza B
was O
great O
. O

and O
everytime O
i O
go O
there's O
a O
bunch O
of O
drunk O
idiots O
making O
a O
scene O
out O
front O
. O

i O
had O
never O
had O
edamame O
pureed B
before O
but O
i O
thought O
it O
was O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
could've O
used O
a O
bit O
more O
salt O
. O

however O
, O
it's O
the O
service B
that O
leaves O
a O
bad O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth O
. O

when O
we O
notified O
him O
that O
he O
didn't O
mention O
the O
specials B
, O
he O
didn't O
apologize O
but O
let O
us O
know O
that O
we O
made O
a O
very O
good O
decision O
regardless O
. O

the O
price B
was O
extremely O
reasonable O
for O
the O
appetizers B
and O
food B
we O
ate O
. O

don't O
dine O
at O
tamarind O
for O
the O
vegetarian B
dishes B
, O
they O
are O
simply O
not O
up O
to O
par O
with O
the O
non O
veg O
selections B
. O

kenny O
the O
owner B
is O
always O
there O
and O
he O
treats O
my O
family O
like O
we O
are O
part O
of O
his O
family O
. O

they O
need O
a O
kick O
out O
of O
it O
but O
until O
then O
the O
sushi B
is O
pretty O
good O
and O
the O
place B
is O
consistent O
. O

i've O
had O
to O
wait B
only O
a O
few O
times O
during O
lunch B
but O
this O
place O
is O
definitely O
worth O
the O
wait B
. O

all O
in O
all O
the O
food B
was O
above O
average O
and O
i O
would O
return O
to O
see O
how O
they O
operate O
with O
four O
or O
less O
dinners B
. O

judging O
from O
previous O
posts O
this O
used O
to O
be O
a O
good O
place O
, O
but O
not O
any O
longer O
. O

delicious O
food B
, O
excellent O
service B
, O
and O
a O
pretty O
atmosphere B
make O
this O
a O
great O
choice O
for O
dinner B
and O
the O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
lunch B
buffet B
makes O
it O
an O
even O
better O
choice O
for O
lunch B
! O

for O
appetizers B
, O
i O
recommend O
the O
shrimp B
fritters B
and O
dumplings B
. O

and O
cheap O
! O

such O
nice O
people B
working O
here O
but O
i O
have O
to O
review O
the O
food B
. O

the O
restaurant O
is O
dark O
and O
not O
very O
attractive O
and O
then O
you O
have O
spot B
lights B
shining O
on O
you O
putting O
you O
in O
the O
worst O
light O
possible O
, O
reaching O
for O
sunglasses O
. O

try O
the O
times O
square O
cocktail B
ginger B
lemonade B
with B
vodka B
also O
available O
without O
vodka B
. O

nice O
find O
. O

veal O
parmigana O
better O
than O
patsy's O
! O

great O
wine B
, O
great O
food B
. O

the O
service B
was O
mediocre O
, O
and O
the O
lack O
of O
air B
conditioning B
made O
for O
a O
less O
than O
comfortable O
meal B
. O

the O
food B
and O
staff B
always O
surprise O
me O
with O
the O
new O
heights O
they O
are O
taken O
to O
. O

amazing O
! O

went O
to O
ottimo O
and O
was O
expecting O
outstanding O
pizza B
as O
i O
love O
la O
pizza B
fresca O
. O

i've O
always O
been O
seated O
propmtly O
. O

we O
try O
frequenting O
new O
restaurants O
all O
over O
the O
city O
, O
but O
any O
time O
that O
we O
visit O
a O
restaurant O
other O
than O
roth's O
we O
are O
always O
disappointed O
. O

honestly O
the O
worst O
sushi B
my O
husband O
and O
i O
had O
in O
our O
entire O
lives O
. O

there O
is O
nothing O
more O
pleasant O
than O
that O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
anyone O
and O
would O
without O
a O
doubt O
come O
again O
. O

however O
, O
if O
you O
want O
great O
food B
at O
a O
great O
price B
and O
don't O
mind O
the O
decor B
, O
you O
can't O
beat O
this O
place O
. O

what O
makes O
this O
restaurant O
special O
are O
the O
authentic O
sichuan B
cooking B
and O
being O
the O
only O
one O
in O
nyc O
that O
offers O
authentic O
chongqing B
hotpot B
. O

mizu O
is O
the O
japenese O
find O
in O
grammercy O
. O

for O
sure O
i O
will O
keep O
coming O
back O
because O
i O
feel O
really O
this O
restaurant O
deserves O
. O

our O
tiny O
table B
for O
two O
dinner B
plates B
hung O
over O
edge O
was O
right O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
one O
of O
the O
lanes O
of O
waiter B
traffic B
. O

sake O
collection B
was O
excellent O
try O
nanbu O
bijin O
, O
but O
pricy O
. O

interesting O
other O
dishes B
for O
a O
change O
include O
chicken B
in B
curry B
sauce O
and O
salmon B
caserole B
. O

one O
of O
my O
favorite O
restaurants O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

one O
of O
my O
favorites O
though O
was O
the O
angry O
lobster B
, O
a O
cold B
lobster B
salad B
that O
was O
magnificent O
. O

i O
have O
to O
say O
that O
i O
am O
pleasantly O
suprised O
and O
i O
will O
most O
likely O
stop O
in O
again O
if O
i O
am O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

ask O
for O
usha O
, O
the O
nicest O
bartender B
in O
manhattan O
. O

the O
service B
is O
outstanding O
and O
my O
crab O
cake O
eggs B
benedict B
could O
not O
have O
been O
better O
. O

the O
place's O
decor B
and O
hidden O
bathrooms B
made O
for O
a O
good O
laugh O
. O

this O
is O
a O
true O
gem O
of O
the O
village O
. O

its O
location B
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
hutner O
college O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices B
are O
very O
reasonable O
, O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
suan O
again O
and O
again O
. O

however O
, O
i O
think O
jeckll O
and O
hydes O
t O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
is O
fun O
to O
do O
once O
. O

they O
treat O
me O
like O
family O
, O
morning O
and O
night O
. O

a O
wonderful O
place B
! O

please O
take O
my O
advice O
, O
go O
and O
try O
this O
place O
. O

service O
was O
on O
par O
but O
not O
wonderful O
. O

for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
had O
an O
excellent O
time O
. O

deliveries O
often O
take O
up O
to O
an O
hour O
and O
the O
prices B
are O
higher O
than O
most O
other O
pizzerias O
in O
the O
area O
. O

i O
went O
to O
amma O
after O
a O
friend O
recommended O
it O
. O

i'm O
just O
reading O
some O
of O
these O
reviews O
and O
its O
nonsense O
that O
people O
are O
reviewing O
some O
places O
because O
it O
was O
too O
loud O
. O

kind O
of O
a O
small O
place B
but O
i O
guess O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
busy O
might O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
group O
or O
kids O
. O

maybe O
tomorrow O
; O

we O
also O
ordered O
two O
hot B
dogs B
thinking O
they O
would O
be O
pretty O
good O
since O
there O
is O
a O
whole O
section O
on O
the O
menu B
devoted O
to O
them O
. O

please O
don't O
fool O
us O
. O

i've O
had O
the O
chicken B
with B
garlic B
sauce B
, O
chicken B
with B
black B
bean B
sauce B
, O
and O
hunan B
chicken B
. O

because O
of O
the O
delicate O
thin O
crust B
, O
take O
out O
pies B
get O
soggy O
in O
their O
boxes O
. O

i O
suspect O
this O
restaurant O
is O
what O
rao's O
would O
be O
if O
it O
hadn't O
turned O
exclusive O
. O

the O
dish B
had O
like O
<number> O
pieces O
of O
beef B
in O
it O
. O

strike O
up O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
attorney O
next O
to O
you O
, O
or O
with O
the O
local O
union O
worker O
on O
the O
other O
side O
. O

we O
were O
then O
shooed O
inside O
. O

we O
got O
in O
line O
and O
were O
served B
while O
in O
line O
a O
bannan B
fritter B
. O

it O
might O
have O
been O
a O
little O
too O
spicy O
for O
my O
friend O
, O
which O
you O
can O
couteract O
with O
eat O
more O
rice B
and O
keeping O
water B
on O
hand O
. O

this O
place B
is O
always O
very O
crowded O
and O
popular O
. O

appetizers O
are O
somewhere O
around O
<number> O
each O
and O
the O
main B
dishes B
are O
between O
<number> O
and O
<number> O
. O

really O
depends O
on O
your O
luck O
! O

just O
went O
here O
for O
my O
girlfriends O
23rd O
bday O
. O

my O
wife O
and O
i O
went O
to O
orsay O
for O
valentine's O
dinner B
. O

i O
don't O
know O
about O
you O
guys O
, O
but O
when O
i O
go O
somewhere O
to O
eat O
i O
go O
for O
the O
food B
not O
for O
the O
atmosphere B
. O

they O
should O
have O
called O
it O
mascarpone B
with B
chocolate B
chips O
good O
but O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
what O
the O
name O
implies O
. O

a O
gentleman O
, O
maybe O
the O
manager B
, O
came O
to O
our O
table B
, O
and O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O
smile O
or O
greeting O
asked O
for O
our O
order O
. O

very O
different O
than O
regular O
dimsum O
places O
. O

i O
have O
lived O
in O
ny O
for O
many O
years O
and O
have O
dined O
at O
many O
restaraunts O
. O

when O
you O
enter O
, O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
have O
entered O
your O
mom's O
kitchen O
. O

we O
were O
tired O
and O
cold O
when O
we O
got O
to O
the O
restaurant O
, O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
to O
begin O
ordering O
appetizers B
. O

i've O
had O
pizza B
both O
times O
and O
the O
caprese B
salad B
appetizer B
. O

she O
lives O
nearby O
but O
had O
never O
gone O
to O
this O
establishment O
thinking O
that O
it O
might O
be O
too O
touristy O
. O

he O
was O
terribly O
thirsty O
after O
the O
meal B
too O
. O

and O
when O
i O
visit O
her O
i O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
eat O
at O
'ino O
at O
least O
once O
daily O
if O
not O
once O
for O
the O
whole O
trip O
. O

i O
wasn't O
there O
for O
the O
half O
price O
saturday O
night O
special O
, O
but O
tuesday O
night O
. O

in O
fact O
, O
it O
appears O
he O
is O
going O
to O
go O
postal O
at O
any O
moment O
. O

there O
was O
a O
small O
group O
of O
us O
looking O
somewhere O
to O
eat O
kinda O
late O
on O
a O
weeknight O
and O
we O
ended O
up O
at O
pastis O
. O

for O
meetball O
night O
. O

if O
you O
like O
the O
food B
and O
the O
value B
you O
get O
from O
some O
of O
chinatown O
restaurants O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
for O
you O
. O

they O
are O
opening O
two O
more O
places O
as O
i O
saw O
a O
flyer O
there O
one O
in O
yonkers O
which O
is O
a O
restraunt O
and O
banquet O
hall O
and O
another O
one O
in O
parsipanny O
new O
jersey O
. O

want O
to O
impress O
? O

the O
selection B
changes O
frequently O
but O
the O
basic B
dishes B
are O
always O
available O
. O

we've O
lived O
in O
the O
area O
for O
more O
than O
<number> O
years O
. O

get O
the O
soup B
and O
a O
nosh B
pastrami O
sandwich O
for O
<number> O
and O
you're O
golden O
. O

i O
have O
to O
say O
that O
if O
this O
what O
makes O
it O
easier O
to O
get O
a O
saet O
a O
lunch B
i O
dont O
mind O
. O

my O
family O
and O
i O
ate O
here O
last O
night O
for O
our O
annual O
christmas O
dinner B
with O
the O
family O
members O
who O
would O
rather O
spend O
the O
holidays O
with O
friends O
out O
of O
town O
. O

i O
grew O
up O
on O
these O
bagels B
. O

we O
were O
told O
that O
they O
were O
booked O
solid O
and O
no O
other O
table B
was O
available O
. O

the O
restaraurant O
is O
very O
small O
so O
reservations B
are O
a O
must O
. O

visited O
there O
while O
on O
vacation O
and O
reading O
the O
reviews O
. O

a O
one O
women O
show O
! O

you O
can't O
go O
wrong O
here O
. O

at O
first O
i O
was O
rolling O
my O
ideas O
of O
yet O
another O
french O
place O
on O
the O
ues O
. O

to O
my O
right O
, O
the O
hostess B
stood O
over O
a O
busboy B
and O
hissed O
rapido O
, O
rapido O
as O
he O
tried O
to O
clear O
and O
re O
set O
a O
table B
for O
six O
. O

in O
china O
the O
phrase O
for O
a O
good O
restaurant O
is O
hot O
and O
loud O
. O

after O
dealing O
with O
subpar O
pizza B
all O
over O
the O
kensington O
neighborhood O
i've O
found O
little O
toninos O
. O

i O
thought O
this O
place O
was O
totally O
overrated O
. O

then O
we O
ordered O
a O
dinosaur B
rolls B
and O
white B
tuna B
sashimi B
. O

you O
won't O
find O
that O
anywhere O
in O
manhattan O
. O

how O
do O
you O
rate O
home O
? O

i O
went O
here O
in O
the O
afternoon O
with O
a O
friend O
. O

our O
first O
greeting O
when O
we O
entered O
was O
the O
last O
call O
is O
at O
<number> O
<number> O
. O

interior O
was O
so O
so O
. O

i'm O
partial O
to O
the O
gnocchi O
. O

i O
guess O
the O
way O
my O
friends O
and O
i O
described O
it O
was O
the O
french O
colonies O
. O

they O
were O
able O
to O
squeeze O
me O
in O
at O
<number> O
after O
i O
called O
the O
night O
before O
my O
anniversary O
for O
a O
friday O
night O
reservation B
and O
told O
me O
they'd O
treat O
us O
well O
for O
the O
occasion O
. O

boy O
was O
i O
wrong O
! O

i O
visit O
new O
green O
bo O
when O
i O
have O
money O
or O
when O
i O
am O
broke O
. O

note O
that O
they O
do O
not O
serve O
beer B
, O
you O
must O
bring O
your O
own O
. O

we O
ate O
outside O
at O
haru's O
sake O
bar B
because O
haru's O
restaurant O
next O
door O
was O
overflowing O
. O

when O
we O
walked O
in O
it O
seemed O
like O
it O
was O
there O
for O
<number> O
years O
. O

ahhh O
. O
. O
. O

better O
than O
the O
bagel O
shop O
on O
the O
corner O
, O
but O
not O
worth O
going O
out O
of O
your O
way O
for O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

it O
helps O
if O
you O
know O
what O
to O
order O
. O

the O
service B
was O
typical O
short O
order O
, O
dinner O
type O
. O

we O
shared O
a O
bottle B
of B
sake B
, O
an O
order O
of B
edamames B
, O
and O
she O
had O
the O
sushi B
plate B
while O
i O
had O
the O
sashimi B
. O

i O
can't O
believe O
people O
complain O
about O
no O
cheese B
sticks B
? O

but O
that O
is O
highly O
forgivable O
. O

from O
the O
appetizers B
we O
ate O
, O
the O
dim B
sum B
and O
other O
variety O
of O
foods B
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
criticize O
the O
food B
. O

when O
we O
arrived O
at O
<number> O
<number> O
pm O
, O
the O
restaurant O
was O
practically O
empty O
. O

each O
table B
has O
a O
pot B
of B
boiling B
water B
sunken O
into O
its O
surface O
, O
and O
you O
get O
platters O
of B
thin O
sliced O
meats B
, O
various O
vegetables B
, O
and O
rice B
and O
glass B
noodles B
. O

i O
am O
going O
to O
the O
mid O
town O
location O
next O
. O
