i O
charge O
it O
at O
night O
and O
skip O
taking O
the O
cord B
with O
me O
because O
of O
the O
good O
battery B
life B
. O

i O
bought O
a O
hp O
pavilion O
dv4 O
1222nr O
laptop O
and O
have O
had O
so O
many O
problems O
with O
the O
computer O
. O

the O
tech B
guy B
then O
said O
the O
service B
center B
does O
not O
do O
<number> O
to O
<number> O
exchange O
and O
i O
have O
to O
direct O
my O
concern O
to O
the O
sales O
team B
, O
which O
is O
the O
retail O
shop O
which O
i O
bought O
my O
netbook O
from O
. O

i O
investigated O
netbooks O
and O
saw O
the O
toshiba O
nb305 O
n410bl O
. O

the O
other O
day O
i O
had O
a O
presentation O
to O
do O
for O
a O
seminar O
at O
a O
large O
conference O
in O
town O
lots O
of O
people O
, O
little O
time O
to O
prep O
and O
have O
to O
set O
up O
a O
computer O
to O
a O
projector O
, O
etc O
. O

it O
is O
of O
high O
quality B
, O
has O
a O
killer O
gui O
, O
is O
extremely O
stable O
, O
is O
highly O
expandable O
, O
is O
bundled O
with O
lots O
of O
very O
good O
applications B
, O
is O
easy O
to O
use B
, O
and O
is O
absolutely O
gorgeous O
. O

easy O
to O
start B
up B
and O
does O
not O
overheat O
as O
much O
as O
other O
laptops O
. O

sad O
very O
sad O
. O

i O
even O
got O
my O
teenage O
son O
one O
, O
because O
of O
the O
features B
that O
it O
offers O
, O
like O
, O
ichat O
, O
photobooth O
, O
garage B
band B
and O
more O
! O

needless O
to O
say O
a O
pc O
that O
can't O
support O
a O
cell O
phone O
is O
less O
than O
useless O
! O

great O
laptop O
that O
offers O
many O
great O
features B
! O

they O
have O
done O
absolutely O
nothing O
to O
fix O
the O
computer O
problem O
. O

one O
night O
i O
turned O
the O
freaking O
thing O
off O
after O
using O
it O
, O
the O
next O
day O
i O
turn O
it O
on O
, O
no O
gui O
, O
screen B
all O
dark O
, O
power B
light B
steady O
, O
hard B
drive B
light B
steady O
and O
not O
flashing O
as O
it O
usually O
does O
. O

still O
pretty O
pricey O
, O
but O
i've O
been O
putting O
off O
money O
for O
a O
while O
as O
a O
little O
macbook O
fund O
, O
and O
finally O
got O
to O
use O
it O
. O

i O
took O
it O
back O
for O
an O
asus O
and O
same O
thing O
blue O
screen O
which O
required O
me O
to O
remove O
the O
battery B
to O
reset O
. O

in O
the O
shop O
, O
these O
macbooks O
are O
encased O
in O
a O
soft O
rubber B
enclosure B
so O
you O
will O
never O
know O
about O
the O
razor O
edge B
until O
you O
buy O
it O
, O
get O
it O
home O
, O
break O
the O
seal O
and O
use O
it O
very O
clever O
con O
. O

however O
, O
the O
multi O
touch O
gestures B
and O
large O
tracking B
area B
make O
having O
an O
external B
mouse B
unnecessary O
unless O
you're O
gaming B
. O

plus O
it O
is O
small O
and O
reasonably O
light O
so O
i O
can O
take O
it O
with O
me O
to O
and O
from O
work O
. O

i O
hate O
this O
one O
. O

they O
were O
totally O
unconcerned O
that O
the O
computer O
was O
not O
correctly O
repaired O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

toshiba O
does O
not O
send O
any O
one O
out O
unless O
you O
have O
paid O
extra O
to O
have O
the O
on O
site O
repair O
done O
. O

oh O
, O
boy O
! O

but O
while O
this O
is O
one O
big O
advantage O
as O
you O
may O
know O
from O
the O
company O
s O
recent O
commercials O
there O
are O
other O
things O
to O
consider O
before O
going O
with O
apple O
. O

i O
love O
the O
way O
the O
entire O
suite B
of B
software B
works O
together O
. O

the O
speed B
is O
incredible O
and O
i O
am O
more O
than O
satisfied O
. O

on O
the O
bright O
side O
at O
least O
i O
wasn't O
without O
my O
laptop O
for O
long O
this O
time O
! O

this O
laptop O
meets O
every O
expectation O
and O
windows O
<number> O
is O
great O
! O

that's O
how O
frustrating O
it O
was O
. O

i O
can O
barely O
use O
any O
usb B
devices B
because O
they O
will O
not O
stay O
connected O
properly O
. O

the O
one O
down O
side O
to O
it O
is O
that O
when O
i O
play O
a O
certin O
game O
on O
here O
, O
it O
tends O
to O
freeze O
up O
sometimes O
, O
but O
thats O
the O
only O
bad O
thing O
about O
this O
computer O
. O

no O
backlit O
keyboard B
, O
but O
not O
an O
issue O
for O
me O
. O

when O
i O
finally O
had O
everything O
running O
with O
all O
my O
software B
installed O
i O
plugged O
in O
my O
droid O
to O
recharge O
and O
the O
system B
crashed O
. O

i O
can't O
even O
turn O
it O
off O
. O

one O
suggestion O
i O
do O
have O
, O
is O
to O
not O
bother O
getting O
microsoft O
office B
for B
the B
mac B
expecting O
it O
will O
work O
just O
like O
you O
knew O
it O
to O
on O
a O
pc O
. O

pairing O
it O
with O
an O
iphone O
is O
a O
pure O
pleasure O
talk O
about O
painless O
syncing B
used O
to O
take O
me O
forever O
now O
it's O
a O
snap O
. O

i O
shopped O
around O
before O
buying O
. O

i O
also O
got O
the O
added O
bonus O
of O
a O
<number> O
hd O
monitor O
, O
which O
really O
helps O
to O
extend O
my O
screen B
and O
keep O
my O
eyes O
fresh O
! O

would O
do O
business O
again O
. O

the O
machine O
is O
slow O
to O
boot B
up B
and O
occasionally O
crashes O
completely O
. O

after O
paying O
several O
hundred O
dollars O
for O
this O
service B
, O
it O
is O
frustrating O
that O
you O
cannot O
get O
help O
after O
hours O
. O

i O
have O
had O
the O
luxury O
sarcasm O
of O
owning O
<number> O
of O
these O
laptops O
. O

what O
a O
waste O
. O

it O
was O
a O
total O
dhell O
experience O
that O
i O
will O
never O
repeat O
. O

there O
are O
a O
few O
flaws O
as O
well O
that O
i O
noticed O
. O

completely O
worth O
every O
single O
penny O
dime O
and O
nickel O
. O

i O
tried O
to O
upgrade O
it O
to O
a O
newer O
version O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
ago O
and O
i O
still O
have O
the O
same O
problem O
. O

i O
did O
have O
to O
replace O
the O
battery B
once O
, O
but O
that O
was O
only O
a O
couple O
months O
ago O
and O
it's O
been O
working O
perfect O
ever O
since O
. O

in O
the O
past O
four O
years O
i've O
had O
it O
i O
have O
never O
once O
gotten O
a O
virus O
. O

i O
love O
the O
operating B
system B
and O
the O
preloaded B
software B
. O

they O
were O
great O
in O
handling O
this O
problem O
, O
and O
i'm O
looking O
forward O
in O
purchasing O
additonal O
products O
from O
them O
in O
the O
future O
. O

i've O
tried O
going O
back O
to O
xl O
but O
there O
still O
problems O
. O

the O
best O
thing O
about O
this O
laptop O
is O
the O
price B
along O
with O
some O
of O
the O
newer O
features B
. O

after O
numerous O
attempts O
of O
trying O
including O
setting O
the O
clock B
in B
bios O
setup B
directly O
, O
i O
gave O
up O
i O
am O
a O
techie O
. O

you O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
talk O
to O
an O
american O
warranty O
service O
is O
out O
of O
country O
. O

but O
it O
may O
be O
potentially O
hundreds O
or O
thousands O
in O
the O
near O
future O
. O

has O
met O
or O
exceeded O
my O
needs O
for O
a O
compact O
travel O
device O
. O

but O
now O
i O
have O
realized O
its O
a O
problem O
with O
this O
brand B
. O

it O
cannot O
save O
the O
correct O
date O
and O
time O
i O
set O
. O

i O
sent O
it O
back O
to O
toshiba O
twice O
they O
covered O
it O
under O
the O
warranty B
. O

and O
this O
isn't O
just O
my O
one O
experine O
. O

they O
sent O
me O
a O
replacement O
part O
and O
without O
informing O
me O
are O
requiring O
that O
i O
return O
it O
within O
<number> O
days O
or O
contact O
them O
and O
let O
them O
know O
the O
broken O
part O
will O
be O
returned O
later O
. O

i O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
mac O
which O
is O
portable O
and O
has O
all O
the O
features B
that O
i O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

i O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
one O
to O
my O
friends O

i O
honestly O
love O
my O
mac O
, O
thats O
why O
i O
am O
a O
self O
proclaimed O
mac O
addict O
. O

and O
these O
are O
some O
reasons O
you O
should O
get O
a O
macbook O
pro O
. O

also O
kinda O
loud O
when O
the O
fan B
was O
running O
. O

in O
desparation O
, O
i O
called O
their O
customer O
service O
number B
and O
was O
told O
that O
my O
warranty B
had O
expired O
<number> O
days O
old O
and O
that O
the O
priviledge O
of O
talking B
to B
a B
technician B
would O
cost O
me O
have O
your O
credit O
card O
ready O
. O

i O
purchased O
this O
laptop O
while O
on O
a O
business O
trip O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
my O
email O
. O

there O
also O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
hard B
disc B
as O
certain O
times O
windows B
loads O
but O
claims O
to O
not O
be O
able O
to O
find O
any O
drivers B
or O
files O
. O

drivers O
updated O
ok O
but O
the O
bios O
update B
froze O
the O
system B
up O
and O
the O
computer O
shut O
down O
. O

they O
lost O
my O
laptop O
for O
a O
month O

spent O
<number> O
hours O
on O
phone O
with O
hp O
technical O
support O
. O

this O
is O
my O
second O
laptop O
, O
and O
it O
is O
head O
and O
shoulders O
above O
my O
first O
. O

at O
first O
! O

speaking O
of O
the O
browser B
, O
it O
too O
has O
problems O
. O

i O
think O
just O
going O
from O
pc O
to O
mac O
has O
gotten O
me O
totally O
spoiled O
and O
i O
can't O
imagine O
ever O
going O
back O
. O

the O
keyboard B
is O
too O
slick O
. O

nightly O
my O
computer O
defrags O
itself O
and O
runs O
a O
virus B
scan B
. O

it's O
like O
<number> O
punds B
, O
but O
if O
you O
can O
look O
past O
it O
, O
it's O
great O
! O

it's O
just O
as O
fast O
with O
one O
program B
open O
as O
it O
is O
with O
sixteen O
open O
. O

still O
under O
warrenty B
so O
called O
toshiba O
, O
no O
help O
at O
all O
. O

i O
was O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
of O
a O
toshiba O
satellite O
l305d O
s5934 O
laptop O
until O
it O
came O
time O
to O
have O
it O
repaired O
under O
the O
toshiba O
warranty O
. O

i O
love O
it O
! O

amazing O
quality O
! O

the O
fact O
that O
you O
can O
spend O
over O
<number> O
on O
just O
a O
webcam B
underscores O
the O
value B
of O
this O
machine O
. O

i O
mainly O
use O
it O
for O
email O
, O
internet B
, O
and O
managing B
personal B
files B
pics O
, O
vids O
, O
etc O
. O
. O

a O
month O
or O
so O
ago O
, O
the O
freaking O
motherboard B
just O
died O
. O

the O
system B
it O
comes O
with O
does O
not O
work O
properly O
, O
so O
when O
trying O
to O
fix O
the O
problems O
with O
it O
it O
started O
not O
working O
at O
all O
. O

then O
after O
<number> O
or O
so O
months O
the O
charger B
stopped O
working O
so O
i O
was O
forced O
to O
go O
out O
and O
buy O
new O
hardware B
just O
to O
keep O
this O
computer O
running O
. O

i O
took O
it O
back O
to O
best O
buy O
where O
they O
were O
so O
helpful O
and O
immediately O
gave O
me O
a O
new O
one O
. O

if O
you O
had O
pc O
for O
four O
years O
i O
can O
almost O
gaurentee O
that O
something O
would O
of O
gone O
wrong O
by O
now O
, O
maybe O
even O
forcing O
you O
to O
replace O
your O
entire O
computer O
. O

<number> O
weeks O
after O
giving O
the O
computer O
for O
repair O
called O
headquarters O
, O
they O
report O
that O
they O
have O
not O
looked O
at O
it O
yet O
but O
it O
is O
on O
the O
top O
of O
the O
stack O
. O

this O
machine O
delivers O
. O

then O
<number> O
of O
my O
nephews O
were O
going O
into O
music O
and O
both O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
the O
macbook O
pro O
. O

i O
complain O
again O
. O
. O
. O

this O
laptop O
is O
insane O
! O
! O
! O

if O
a O
website O
ever O
freezes O
which O
is O
rare O
, O
its O
really O
easy O
to O
force B
quit B
. O

it O
does O
run O
a O
little O
warm O
but O
that O
is O
a O
negligible O
concern O
. O

it O
rarely O
works B
and O
when O
it O
does O
it's O
incredibly O
slow O
. O

i O
also O
enjoy O
the O
fact O
that O
my O
macbook O
pro O
laptop O
allows O
me O
to O
run O
windows O
<number> O
on O
it O
by O
using O
the O
vmware O
program B
. O

it's O
so O
much O
easier O
to O
navigate B
through O
the O
operating B
system B
, O
to O
find B
files B
, O
and O
it O
runs B
a O
lot O
faster O
! O

purchased O
a O
toshiba O
lap O
top O
it O
worked O
good O
until O
just O
after O
the O
warrenty B
went O
out O
. O

i O
always O
swore O
by O
pcs O
and O
would O
never O
consider O
a O
mac O
. O

what O
an O
elegant O
, O
wonderful O
machine O
. O

this O
is O
now O
my O
3rd O
macbook O
pro O
and O
i O
really O
honestly O
love O
it O
! O

for O
<number> O
months O
. O

i O
wanted O
to O
purchase O
the O
extended B
warranty B
and O
they O
refused O
, O
because O
they O
knew O
it O
was O
trouble O
. O

do O
you O
ever O
think O
hp O
would O
do O
that O
? O
never O
! O

we O
upgraded O
the O
memory B
to O
four O
gigabytes O
in O
order O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
performace B
increase O
in O
speed B
. O

it's O
not O
like O
i O
have O
used O
for O
half O
a O
year O
and O
then O
complained O
about O
it O
. O

still O
trying O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
use O
it O
. O

the O
reality O
was O
, O
it O
heated O
up O
very O
quickly O
, O
and O
took O
way O
too O
long O
to O
do O
simple O
things O
, O
like O
opening B
my B
documents O
folder B
. O

i O
bought O
the O
netbook O
because O
it O
was O
smaller O
and O
lighter O
for O
me O
to O
carry O
around O
. O

the O
genius O
at O
the O
apple O
store O
advised O
me O
that O
there O
was O
nothing O
about O
my O
use O
of O
the O
computer O
that O
caused O
this O
failure O
. O

we'll O
save O
our O
money O
to O
replace O
it O
with O
a O
mac O
again O
! O

thank O
you O
for O
your O
great O
product O
! O

this O
company O
truely O
does O
make O
horrible O
products O
and O
doesnt O
seem O
to O
because O
they O
are O
certain O
things O
like O
this O
never O
happen O
. O
. O
. O

i O
had O
always O
used O
pcs O
and O
been O
constantly O
frustrated O
by O
the O
crashing O
and O
the O
poorly O
designed O
operating B
systems B
that O
were O
never O
very O
intuitive O
. O

sorry O
toshiba O
, O
but O
1st O
impressions O
do O
count O
for O
something O
. O

then O
, O
within O
<number> O
months O
, O
the O
charger B
crapped O
out O
on O
me O
. O

and O
if O
you O
have O
a O
iphone O
or O
ipod O
touch O
you O
can O
connect O
and O
download O
songs O
to O
it O
at O
high O
speed B
. O

overall O
this O
laptop O
is O
great O
. O

i O
love O
the O
glass B
touchpad B
. O

i O
continued O
to O
take O
the O
computer O
in O
again O
and O
they O
replaced O
the O
hard B
drive B
and O
mother B
board B
yet O
again O
. O

i O
am O
using O
the O
external B
speaker B
sound B
is O
good O

mc371ll O
a O
<number> O
. O
4ghz O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
inch O
macbook O
pro O
notebook O
is O
a O
horrible O
waste O
of O
money O
. O

ok O
, O
this O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
laptop O
series O
ever O
devised O
by O
apple O
. O

as O
of O
a O
couple O
weeks O
ago O
the O
middle O
portion O
of O
the O
laptop O
from O
top O
to O
bottom O
, O
, O
, O
about O
<number> O
inches O
across O
is O
hardly O
visible O
. O

still O
testing O
the O
battery B
life B
as O
i O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
better O
, O
but O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
upgrade O
. O

then O
hp O
sends O
it O
back O
to O
me O
with O
the O
hardware B
screwed O
up O
, O
not O
able O
to O
connect O
. O

i O
just O
hope O
the O
reputation O
that O
toshiba O
has O
is O
true O
and O
i O
won't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
a O
crash O
. O

oh O
yeah O
, O
don't O
forget O
the O
expensive O
shipping B
to O
and O
from O
hp O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
anyone O
to O
buy O
from O
pcconnection O
express O
. O

good O
luck O
. O

everything O
is O
so O
easy O
to O
use B
, O
mac O
software B
is O
just O
so O
much O
simpler O
than O
microsoft O
software B
. O

my O
favorite O
by O
far O
, O
although O
the O
most O
expensive O
, O
was O
my O
sony O
. O

and O
if O
you O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
writing O
, O
editing B
is O
a O
problem O
since O
there O
is O
no O
forward O
delete B
key B
. O

also O
i O
typed O
faster O
then O
then O
letters O
would O
show O
and O
it O
got O
to O
be O
realy O
annoying O
. O

as O
an O
owner O
of O
a O
toshiba O
satalite O
laptop O
computer O
things O
you O
should O
know O
before O
you O
buy O
. O

its O
ease O
of O
use B
and O
the O
top O
service B
from O
apple O
be O
it O
their O
phone B
assistance B
or O
bellying O
up O
to O
the O
genius B
bar B
cannot O
be O
beat O
. O

it O
has O
a O
<number> O
hour O
battery B
life B
when O
you're O
doing O
web B
browsing B
and O
word B
editing B
, O
making O
it O
perfect O
for O
the O
classroom O
or O
office O
, O
and O
in O
terms O
of O
gaming B
and O
movie B
playing B
it'll O
have O
a O
battery B
life B
of O
just O
over O
<number> O
hours O
. O

i O
shipped O
out O
on O
saturday O
, O
july O
<number> O
. O

i O
bought O
it O
for O
really O
cheap O
also O
and O
it's O
amazing O
. O

acer O
has O
set O
me O
up O
with O
free O
recovery B
discs B
, O
when O
they O
are O
available O
since O
i O
asked O
. O

i O
also O
purchased O
office O
max's O
max O
assurance O
with O
the O
no O
lemon O
clause O
. O

if O
you O
find O
yourself O
in O
the O
market O
for O
a O
new O
laptop O
and O
have O
the O
money O
don't O
exclude O
looking O
at O
the O
mbps O
. O

i O
eventually O
did O
the O
migration O
from O
my O
imac O
backup B
disc B
which O
uses O
usb O
. O

those O
things O
are O
very O
important O
vital O
even O
! O

they O
say O
it O
will O
take O
up O
to O
two O
weeks O
. O

i O
didn't O
like O
one O
thing O
about O
it O
. O

the O
battery B
life B
seems O
to O
be O
very O
good O
, O
and O
have O
had O
no O
issues O
with O
it O
. O

enabling O
the O
battery B
timer B
is O
useless O
. O

temperatures B
on O
the O
outside O
were O
alright O
but O
i O
did O
not O
track O
in O
core O
processing O
unit O
temperatures B
. O

yeah O
, O
to O
you O
. O

i O
got O
a O
mac O

my O
hs O
graduation O
gift O
. O

i O
have O
now O
had O
it O
for O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
months O
and O
love O
it O
. O

it O
turned O
out O
it's O
not O
really O
a O
problem O
to O
have O
a O
mac O
. O

page O
just O
disapeared O
after O
you O
got O
yahoo O
or O
downloaded O
something O
. O

images O
can O
be O
multi O
selected O
and O
viewed O
swiftly O
or O
in O
slideshow O
mode O
. O

going O
to O
bring O
it O
to O
service B
today O
. O

there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
purchase O
virus B
protection B
for B
mac O
, O
which O
saves O
me O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
and O
money O
. O

but O
we O
had O
paid O
for O
bluetooth B
, O
and O
there O
was O
none O
. O

so O
, O
i O
paid O
a O
visit O
to O
lg O
notebook B
service B
center B
at O
alexandra O
road O
, O
hoping O
they O
can O
make O
the O
hinge B
tighter O
. O

my O
daughter O
uses O
it O
for O
games B
, O
email O
, O
facebook O
, O
pictures O
and O
music O
. O

laptop O
is O
to O
be O
used O
like O
a O
netbook O
. O

it O
is O
always O
reliable O
, O
never O
bugged O
and O
responds B
well O
. O

after O
about O
a O
week O
i O
finally O
got O
it O
back O
and O
was O
told O
that O
the O
motherboard B
had O
failed O
and O
so O
they O
installed O
a O
new O
motherboard B
. O

trying O
to O
balance O
all O
of O
my O
roles O
leaves O
very O
little O
time O
for O
me O
to O
do O
anything O
, O
so O
i O
want O
to O
manage O
my O
time O
i O
do O
have O
to O
be O
the O
most O
efficient O
. O

it O
was O
slow O
, O
locked O
up O
, O
and O
also O
had O
hardware B
replaced O
after O
only O
<number> O
months O
! O

they O
had O
to O
replace O
the O
motherboard B
in O
april O

yes O
, O
the O
computer O
was O
light O
weight O
, O
less O
expensive O
than O
the O
average O
laptop O
, O
and O
was O
pretty O
self O
explantory O
in O
use B
. O

also O
, O
if O
you O
need O
to O
talk O
to O
a O
representive B
at B
microsoft O
, O
there O
is O
a O
charge O
, O
which O
i O
believe O
is O
robbery O
, O
since O
you O
are O
charged O
enormous O
amounts O
for O
a O
very O
badly O
designed O
system B
, O
which O
most O
people O
would O
have O
went O
with O
xp O
if O
they O
could O
. O

there O
is O
a O
little O
indent O
to O
help O
open O
it O
but O
good O
luck O
with O
that O
. O

i O
love O
windows O
<number> O
which O
is O
a O
vast O
improvment O
over O
vista O
. O

also O
, O
i O
have O
alot O
of O
trouble O
with O
it O
getting O
very O
hot O
, O
and O
not O
even O
sitting O
on O
anything O
to O
make O
it O
hot O
. O

it O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
after O
all O
. O

this O
mac O
is O
great O
! O

keyboard O
is O
great O
, O
very O
quiet O
for O
all O
the O
typing O
that O
i O
do O
. O

i O
grew O
up O
in O
a O
design O
family O
so O
it O
only O
made O
sense O
. O

gave O
phonenumber O
. O

it O
would O
take O
up O
too O
much O
time O
to O
do O
reaearch O
for O
my O
papers O
and O
i O
would O
be O
up O
hours O
just O
because O
the O
computer O
was O
too O
slow O
. O

oh O
my O
goodness O
i O
am O
not O
a O
happy O
camper O
. O

dell's O
customer B
disservice B
is O
an O
insult O
to O
it's O
customers O
who O
pay O
good O
money O
for O
shoddy O
products O
. O

i'd O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
to O
anyone O
! O

yet O
, O
hp O
won't O
do O
anything O
about O
the O
problem O
. O

i'm O
returning O
mine O

it O
had O
a O
cooling B
system B
malfunction O
after O
<number> O
minutes O
of O
general O
use B
, O
and O
would O
not O
move O
past O
this O
error O
. O

i O
can O
render O
avchd O
movies O
with O
little O
effort O
, O
which O
was O
a O
problem O
for O
most O
pc's O
unless O
you O
had O
a O
quad B
core B
i7 O
. O

it's O
a O
bummer O
and O
one O
out O
of O
five O
is O
being O
kind O
. O

this O
is O
what O
they O
told O
me O
it O
heats O
up O
, O
and O
that O
is O
the O
reason O
we O
no O
longer O
call O
them O
laptops O
, O
and O
simply O
categorize O
them O
as O
portables O
. O

after O
talking O
it O
over O
with O
the O
very O
knowledgeable O
sales B
associate B
, O
i O
chose O
the O
macbook O
pro O
over O
the O
white O
macbook O
. O

if O
you O
really O
want O
a O
bang O
up O
system B
and O
don't O
need O
to O
run O
windows O
applications B
, O
go O
with O
an O
apple O
; O

you O
won't O
have O
to O
spend O
gobs O
of O
money O
on O
some O
inefficient O
virus B
program B
that O
needs O
to O
be O
updated O
every O
month O
and O
that O
constantly O
drains O
your O
wallet O
. O

this O
laptop O
is O
fast O
and O
you O
will O
literally O
learn O
all O
you O
can O
do O
with O
this O
dynamo O
by O
just O
watching O
the O
online O
tutorials O
. O

one O
of O
them O
seems O
to O
have O
worked O
. O

which O
i O
still O
use O
and O
have O
hooked O
up O
to O
my O
tv O
. O

the O
problem O
i O
had O
with O
this O
unit O
was O
unresolvable O
. O

it O
weighed B
like O
seven B
pounds B
or O
something O
like O
that O
. O

<number> O
months O
later O
, O
the O
battery B
went O
. O

you O
may O
need O
to O
special O
order O
a O
bag B
. O

it's O
color B
is O
even O
cool O
. O

and O
it O
has O
blue O
screen O
crashed O
on O
me O
twice O
. O

another O
two O
weeks O
later O
and O
it O
was O
back O
in O
my O
possession O
. O

keys B
are O
all O
in O
weird O
places O
and O
is O
way O
too O
large O
for O
the O
way O
it O
is O
designed B
. O

i've O
owned O
every O
pro O
model O
apple O
laptop O
for O
the O
last O
<number> O
years O
, O
this O
is O
by O
far O
the O
worst O
one O
i've O
ever O
had O
. O

we O
purchase O
the O
dell O
xps O
several O
years O
ago O
for O
my O
home O
business O
. O

have O
purchased O
many O
products O
over O
the O
years O
from O
macconnection O
and O
this O
transaction O
, O
like O
all O
the O
others O
, O
we O
smoothly O
with O
no O
problems O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
anyone O
to O
buy O
from O
pcconnection O
express O
. O

yes O
, O
a O
mac O
is O
much O
more O
money O
than O
the O
average O
laptop O
out O
there O
, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O
in O
style B
, O
speed B
and O
just O
cool O
factor O
. O

he O
gave O
me O
this O
pc O
about O
<number> O
years O
ago O
and O
up O
to O
this O
point O
im O
still O
sitting O
here O
using O
it O
. O

i'm O
pleased O
. O

the O
keyboard B
feels O
good O
and O
i O
type O
just O
fine O
on O
it O
. O

with O
a O
healthy O
pessimism O
, O
i O
took O
the O
machine O
home O
and O
tried O
to O
find O
a O
flaw O
. O

shiny O
this O
laptop O
is O
the O
best O
of O
the O
best O
! O

i O
thought O
the O
white O
mac O
computers O
looked O
dirty O
too O
quicly O
where O
you O
use O
the O
mousepad B
and O
where O
you O
place O
your O
hands O
when O
typing O
. O

and O
not O
to O
mention O
after O
using O
it O
for O
a O
few O
months O
or O
so O
, O
the O
battery B
will O
slowly O
less O
and O
less O
hold O
a O
charge O
until O
you O
can't O
leave O
it O
unplugged O
for O
more O
than O
<number> O
minutes O
without O
the O
thing O
dying O
. O

don't O
waste O
their O
money O
, O
save O
it O
and O
but O
a O
mac O
. O

money O
and O
time O
well O
spent O
! O

gradually O
the O
freezing O

evolved O
into O
a O

i O
now O
travel O
with O
this O

my O

i O
am O
however O

that O
it O
is O

hanging O
in O

both O
my O
husband O
and O
i O
have O
this O
model O
toshiba O
. O

no O
complaints O
with O
their O
desktop O
, O
and O
maybe O
because O
it O
just O
sits O
on O
your O
desktop O
, O
and O
you O
don't O
carry O
it O
around O
, O
which O
could O
jar O
the O
hard B
drive B
, O
or O
the O
motherboard B
. O

yes O
, O
they O
cost B
more O
, O
but O
they O
more O
than O
make O
up O
for O
it O
in O
speed B
, O
construction B
quality B
, O
and O
longevity B
. O

since O
i O
keyboard B
over O
<number> O
wpm O
, O
i O
look O
for O
a O
unit O
that O
has O
a O
comfortble O
keyboard B
no O
keys B
sticking O
or O
lagging O
, O
strange O
configuration B
of B
extra O
key O
, O
etc O
. O

i O
also O
tried O
the O
touch B
pad B
and O
compared O
it O
to O
other O
netbooks O
in O
the O
store O
. O

it O
absolutely O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
most O
pc O
laptops O
, O
but O
the O
ease O
of O
use B
, O
security B
, O
and O
minimal O
problems O
that O
have O
arisen O
make O
it O
well O
worth O
the O
pricetag B
. O

it O
gets O
stuck O
all O
of O
the O
time O
you O
use B
it O
, O
and O
you O
have O
to O
keep O
tapping O
on O
it O
to O
get O
it O
to O
work B
. O

lots O
of O
preloaded B
software B
. O

sony O
, O
acer O
, O
dell O
, O
packard O
bell O
and O
toshiba O
. O

and O
then O
, O
a O
guy O
came O
out O
to O
serve O
me O
instead O
. O

breaking O
within O
<number> O
year O
of O
purchase O
and O
speaking O
to O
<number> O
people O
to O
report O
the O
damaged O
part O
will O
be O
returned O
late O
! O

have O
returned O
that O
laptop O
unused O
. O

will O
probably O
never O
buy O
a O
hp O
again O
. O

i O
got O
tired O
of O
buying O
laptops O
and O
having O
them O
stop O
working O
after O
a O
year O
. O

i O
should O
have O
been O
more O
observant O
. O

i O
wish O
it O
had O
a O
webcam B
though O
, O
then O
it O
would O
be O
perfect O
! O

my O
favorite O
part O
of O
this O
computer O
is O
that O
it O
has O
a O
vga B
port B
so O
i O
can O
connect O
it O
to O
a O
bigger O
screen B
. O

another O
thing O
i O
might O
add O
is O
the O
battery B
life B
is O
excellent O
. O

one O
drawback O
, O
i O
wish O
the O
keys B
were O
backlit O
. O

when O
the O
buyer O
returned O
it O
wal O
mart O
just O
boxed O
it O
, O
taped O
it O
shut O
resold O
it O
as O
new O
. O

what O
a O
great O
little O
laptop O
. O

acer O
was O
no O
help O
and O
garmin O
could O
not O
determine O
the O
problem O
after O
spending O
about O
<number> O
hours O
with O
me O
, O
so O
i O
returned O
it O
and O
purchased O
a O
toshiba O
r700 O
that O
seems O
even O
nicer O
and O
i O
was O
able O
to O
load O
all O
of O
my O
software B
with O
no O
problem O
. O

i O
wish O
the O
volume B
could O
be O
louder O
and O
the O
mouse B
didnt O
break O
after O
only O
a O
month O
. O

i O
play O
a O
lot O
of O
casual O
games O
online O
, O
and O
the O
touchpad B
is O
very O
responsive O
. O

granted O
, O
it's O
still O
a O
very O
new O
laptop O
but O
in O
comparison O
to O
my O
previous O
laptops O
and O
desktops O
, O
my O
mac O
boots B
up B
noticeably O
quicker O
. O

it O
caught O
a O
virus O
that O
completely O
wiped O
out O
my O
hard B
drive B
in O
a O
matter O
of O
hours O
. O

would O
pay O
more O
for O
it O
if O
i O
had O
too O
! O

couldn't O
keep O
a O
page O
up O
you O
were O
working O
on O
! O

it O
is O
everything O
i'd O
hoped O
it O
would O
be O
from O
a O
look B
and B
feel B
standpoint B
, O
but O
somehow O
a O
bit O
more O
sturdy O
. O

the O
only O
fact O
i O
dont O
like O
about O
apples O
is O
they O
generally O
use O
safari B
and O
i O
dont O
use O
safari B
but O
after O
i O
install O
mozzilla O
firfox B
i O
love O
every O
single O
bit O
about O
it O
. O

the O
bluetooth O
was O
not O
there O
at O
all O
, O
and O
the O
fingerprint B
reader B
driver B
would O
be O
there O
, O
but O
the O
software B
would O
hang O
after O
installation O
was O
<number> O
<number> O
way O
done O
. O

great O
battery B
, O
speed B
, O
display B
. O

i O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
product O
to O
anyone O
. O

i O
like O
to O
use O
it O
at O
the O
race O
track O
to O
handiecap O
the O
horse O
races O
. O

i O
was O
given O
a O
mac O
as O
a O
birthday O
present O
and O
couldn't O
be O
happier O
with O
it O
<number> O
years O
later O
. O

the O
delivery B
was O
fast O
, O
and O
i O
would O
not O
hesitate O
to O
purchase O
this O
laptop O
again O
. O

i've O
been O
impressed O
with O
the O
battery B
life B
and O
the O
performance B
for O
such O
a O
small O
amount O
of O
memory B
. O

do O
a O
quick O
search O
on O
the O
internet O
see O
if O
im O
the O
only O
one O
. O

i'm O
extremely O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
as O
i O
now O
have O
the O
portable O
power O
i O
have O
been O
looking O
for O
. O

it's O
applications B
are O
terrific O
, O
including O
the O
replacements O
for O
microsoft O
office B
. O

they O
improved O
nothing O
else O
such O
as O
resolution O
, O
appearance B
, O
cooling B
system B
, O
graphics B
card B
, O
etc O
. O

i O
got O
it O
back O
and O
my O
built O
in O
webcam B
and O
built O
in O
mic B
were O
shorting O
out O
anytime O
i O
touched O
the O
lid O
, O
mind O
you O
this O
was O
my O
means O
of O
communication O
with O
my O
fiance O
who O
was O
deployed O
but O
i O
suffered O
thru O
it O
and O
would O
constandly O
have O
to O
reset O
the O
computer O
to O
be O
able O
to O
use O
my O
cam B
and O
mic B
anytime O
they O
went O
out O
. O

is O
this O
partially O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
is O
running O
windows O
vista O
? O

you O
might O
think O
, O
i O
am O
new O
in O
this O
game O
, O
but O
i O
am O
a O
gadget O
lover O
, O
and O
have O
had O
more O
than O
<number> O
dozens O
laptops O
in O
the O
past O
<number> O
years O
, O
and O
none O
gets O
this O
hot O
, O
that O
fast O
. O

i O
was O
informed O
that O
i O
need O
to O
call O
some O
<number> O
number O
first O
. O

i O
really O
wanted O
a O
mac O
over O
a O
pc O
because O
i O
used O
a O
mac O
in O
high O
school O
. O

<number> O
payed O
<number> O
for O
a O
premium O
laptop O

i O
bought O
them O
for O
my O
college O
age O
grandchildren O
and O
these O
macs O
are O
totally O
reliable O
and O
support O
their O
class O
work O
<number> O
of O
the O
time O
. O

the O
board B
has O
a O
bad O
connector B
with O
the O
power B
supply B
and O
shortly O
after O
warrenty B
expires O
the O
power B
supply B
will O
start O
having O
issues O
. O

do O
not O
purchase O
this O
laptop O
. O

my O
dad O
has O
one O
of O
the O
very O
first O
toshibas O
ever O
made O
, O
yes O
its O
abit O
slow O
now O
but O
still O
works B
well O
and O
i O
hooked O
to O
my O
ethernet B
! O

mostly O
i O
love O
the O
drag B
and B
drop B
feature B
. O

oh O
yeah O
, O
and O
if O
the O
fancy O
webcam B
breaks O
guess O
who O
you O
have O
to O
send O
it O
to O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
? O

she O
brought O
out O
<number> O
other O
identical O
netbooks O
and O
still O
insist O
that O
it O
is O
like O
that O
one O
. O

i O
ordered O
through O
macmall O
, O
which O
saved O
me O
the O
sales B
tax B
i O
would O
have O
incurred O
buying O
locally O
. O

very O
fast O
and O
efficient O
! O

of O
course O
, O
i O
also O
have O
several O
great O
software B
packages B
that O
came O
for O
free O
including O
iwork O
, O
garageband O
, O
and O
imovie O
. O

being O
virus O
resistant O
is O
a O
huge O
plus O
. O

the O
screen B
is O
very O
large O
and O
crystal O
clear O
with O
amazing O
colors B
and O
resolution B
. O

after O
a O
little O
more O
than O
a O
year O
of O
owning O
my O
macbook O
pro O
, O
the O
monitor B
has O
completely O
died O
. O

in O
my O
house O
, O
hp O
is O
a O
nasty O
word O
. O

the O
brand O
of O
itunes O
has O
just O
become O
ingrained O
in O
our O
lexicon O
now O
, O
but O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
apple O
started O
it O
all O
. O

by O
the O
way O
teachers O
, O
they O
offer O
a O
discount O
which O
helps O
! O

now O
he O
mows O
yards O
so O
he O
can O
earn O
the O
money O
for O
the O
wireless O
internet O
. O

i O
still O
see O
the O
benefits O
of O
a O
pc O
when O
i O
do O
not O
know O
how O
to O
do O
something O
on O
my O
mac O
. O

size O
i O
know O
<number> O
is O
small O
especially O
for O
a O
desktop O
replacement O
but O
with O
an O
external B
monitor B
, O
who O
cares O
. O

additional O
caveat O
the O
base B
installation B
comes O
with O
some O
toshiba O
specific O
software B
that O
may O
or O
may O
not O
be O
to O
a O
user's O
liking O
. O

it O
is O
held O
in O
place O
magnetically O
. O

taking O
it O
back O
to O
best O
buy O
i O
found O
that O
a O
tiny O
plastic O
piece O
inside O
had O
broken O
manuf B
issue O
. O

it O
has O
no O
camera B
but O
, O
i O
can O
always O
buy O
and O
install O
one O
easy O
. O

the O
display B
is O
incredibly O
bright O
, O
much O
brighter O
than O
my O
powerbook O
and O
very O
crisp O
. O

we O
were O
pc O
users O
. O

the O
amd O
turin O
processor B
seems O
to O
always O
perform O
so O
much O
better O
than O
intel O
. O

after O
that O
the O
said O
it O
was O
under O
warranty B
. O

the O
start B
menu B
is O
not O
the O
easiest O
thing O
to O
navigate B
due O
to O
the O
stacking O
. O

only O
thing O
i O
would O
want O
to O
add O
to O
this O
is O
an O
internal O
bluray B
read O
write O
drive B
. O

this O
computer O
was O
awful O
, O
i O
would O
never O
recomend O
it O
to O
another O
person O
. O

the O
service B
tech B
said O
he O
had O
tried O
to O
duplicate O
the O
damage O
and O
wasn't O
able O
to O
recreate O
it O
therefore O
it O
had O
to O
be O
their O
defect O
. O

the O
tech B
store B
i O
purchased O
this O
from O
sent O
it O
back O
, O
, O
, O
, O
, O
eventually O
i O
got O
a O
new O
or O
repaired O
machine O
approximately O
<number> O
weeks O
later O
. O

i O
loved O
it O
then O
, O
but O
unfortunately O
it O
was O
before O
the O
days O
of O
wireless O
internet O
. O

really O
like O
the O
textured O
surface B
which O
shows O
no O
fingerprints O
. O

i O
will O
never O
again O
buy O
another O
acer O
, O
not O
will O
i O
buy O
gateway O
, O
or O
emachine O
as O
they O
are O
all O
from O
the O
same O
company O
. O

the O
screen B
is O
bright O
and O
the O
keyboard B
is O
nice O
; O

i O
look O
forward O
to O
years O
of O
use O
, O
it O
has O
held O
up O
well O
over O
the O
years O
and O
it O
fits O
my O
needs O
very O
well O
. O

im O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
computer O
! O

but O
the O
machine O
is O
awesome O
and O
ilife O
is O
great O
and O
i O
love O
snow O
leopard O
x O
. O

high O
price B
tag B
, O
however O
. O

i O
thought O
learning O
the O
mac O
os O
would O
be O
hard O
, O
but O
it O
is O
easily O
picked O
up O
if O
you O
are O
familiar O
with O
a O
pc O
. O

my O
kids O
have O
to O
take O
their O
pcs O
in O
once O
a O
year O
to O
have O
them O
de O
bugged O
. O

i O
had O
static O
in O
the O
output B
, O
and O
i O
had O
to O
reduce O
the O
sound B
output B
quality B
to O
fm O
as O
opposed O
to O
the O
default O
cd O
. O

it O
was O
a O
laugh O
too O
! O

since O
i O
purchased O
my O
toshiba O
netbook O
, O
i O
have O
been O
very O
pleased O
with O
it O
, O
i O
have O
a O
laptob O
and O
a O
desktop O
. O

i O
bought O
my O
macbook O
a O
few O
months O
ago O
and O
it O
has O
been O
my O
baby O
ever O
since O
. O

that O
is O
how O
it O
is O
able O
to O
function O
better O
than O
any O
other O
pc O
. O

i O
custom O
ordered O
the O
machine O
from O
hp O
and O
could O
not O
understand O
the O
techie B
due O
to O
his O
accent O
. O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
use B
and O
lightweight O
. O

i O
went O
to O
toshiba O
online B
help B
and O
found O
some O
suggestions O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

it O
is O
a O
bit O
heavy O
. O

after O
trying O
to O
get O
some O
help O
he O
disconnected O
on O
me O
. O

they O
also O
have O
a O
longer O
service B
life B
than O
other O
computers O
i O
have O
several O
friends O
who O
still O
use O
the O
older O
apple O
powerbooks O
. O

if O
you O
check O
you O
will O
find O
the O
same O
notebook O
with O
the O
above O
missing O
ports B
and O
a O
dual O
core O
amd O
or O
intel O
processor B
. O

this O
laptop O
is O
a O
great O
price B
and O
has O
a O
sleek O
look B
. O

i O
especially O
like O
the O
keyboard B
which O
has O
chiclet O
type O
keys B
. O

small O
screen B
somewhat O
limiting O
but O
great O
for O
travel O
. O

one O
of O
the O
primary O
reasons O
why O
i O
purchased O
an O
ipad O
was O
to O
store O
photographs O
so O
that O
i O
could O
show O
to O
my O
customers O
. O

runs O
hot O
i O
thought O
we O
were O
paying O
for O
quality B
in O
our O
decision O
to O
buy O
an O
apple O
product O
. O

for O
the O
not O
so O
good O
, O
i O
got O
the O
stock B
screen B
which O
is O
very O
glossy O
. O

the O
gray B
color B
was O
a O
good O
choice O
. O

this O
was O
the O
second O
computer O
and O
brand O
bought O
that O
day O
. O

buy O
this O
. O

very O
disappointing O

i O
love O
this O
product O
because O
it O
is O
toshiba O
and O
its O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
. O

i O
would O
like O
to O
have O
volume B
buttons B
rather O
than O
the O
adjustment O
that O
is O
on O
the O
front O
. O

this O
is O
my O
first O
computer O
purchase O

people O
know O
what O
they O
are O
talking O
about O
and O
they O
have O
pride O
in O
the O
product O
that O
they O
are O
selling O
. O

the O
processor B
a O
amd O
semprom O
at O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
ghz O
is O
a O
bummer O
it O
does O
not O
have O
the O
power O
for O
hd O
or O
heavy O
computing B
. O

would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
netbook O
though O
. O

i O
have O
had O
several O
machines O
over O
the O
years O
, O
both O
for O
personal O
and O
business O
use O
. O

i O
bought O
a O
protector B
for O
my O
key B
pad B
and O
it O
works O
great O

the O
magnetic B
plug O
in O
power B
charging B
power B
cord B
is O
great O
i O
even O
put O
it O
to O
the O
test O
by O
accident O
excellent O
innovation O
! O

well O
i O
got O
this O
computer O
from O
best O
buy O
and O
i O
have O
had O
nothing O
but O
problems O
i O
bought O
the O
computer O
with O
a O
virus O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O

it O
seems O
they O
could O
have O
updated O
xp O
and O
done O
without O
creating O
vista O
. O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
use B
, O
fast O
and O
has O
great O
graphics B
for O
the O
money O
. O

i O
decided O
i O
wanted O
a O
laptop O
so O
i O
went O
into O
the O
bby O
store O
. O

i O
like O
how O
the O
mac O
os O
is O
so O
simple O
and O
easy O
to O
use B
. O

while O
apple's O
saving O
grace O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
at O
least O
stand O
behind O
their O
products O
, O
and O
their O
support B
is O
great O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
if O
their O
products O
were O
more O
reliable O
to O
justify O
the O
premium O
. O

in O
the O
three O
years O
i've O
had O
my O
macbook O
pro O
, O
i O
have O
never O
had O
a O
virus O
on O
my O
computer O
, O
and O
i O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
on O
the O
internet O
. O

i O
was O
ready O
to O
take O
it O
back O
for O
a O
refund O
, O
but O
the O
geek O
squad O
camed O
through O
and O
pointed O
me O
in O
the O
right O
direction O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
. O

i O
have O
had O
laptops O
in O
the O
past O
and O
i O
thought O
why O
not O
give O
these O
small O
netbooks O
a O
try O
. O

it O
can't O
get O
any O
better O
. O

all O
the O
problems O
i O
have O
had O
with O
pc's O
are O
solved O
with O
a O
mac O
the O
issue O
of O
overheating O
my O
dell O
was O
always O
overheating O
and O
not O
working O
properly O
or O
simply O
shutting O
off O
, O
and O
the O
issue O
of O
viruses O
and O
contaminants O
my O
hp O
completely O
quit O
working O
within2 O
years O
of O
purchasing O
it O
, O
with O
no O
inexpensive O
way O
of O
fixing O
it O
. O

only O
good O
thing O
is O
the O
graphics B
quality B
. O

the O
other O
lock O
up O
problems O
are O
from O
a O
myriad O
of O
causes O
, O
the O
most O
common O
being O
a O
corrupted O
version O
of O
appleworks O
which O
can O
render O
the O
browser B
useless O
. O

in O
short O
i O
would O
never O
buy O
a O
compaq O
again O
. O

i O
love O
the O
<number> O
macbook O
pro O
. O

breaks O
easily O
. O

the O
paint B
wears O
off O
easily O
due O
to O
the O
keyboard B
being O
farther O
back O
than O
usual O
. O

that's O
right O
, O
no O
power O
, O
absolutely O
nothing O
. O

i O
had O
purchased O
it O
from O
a O
major O
electronics O
store O
and O
took O
it O
to O
their O
service B
department B
to O
find O
out O
what O
the O
problem O
was O
. O

the O
store O
honored O
their O
warrenty B
and O
made O
the O
comment O
that O
they O
don't O
even O
recommend O
the O
hp O
brand O
because O
of O
the O
problems O
with O
their O
warrentys B
. O

but O
i O
was O
wrong O
. O

no O
good O
. O

i O
always O
use O
a O
backup O
hard B
disk B
to O
store O
important O
files O
at O
all O
times O
. O

they O
sent O
out O
the O
box O
right O
away O
for O
me O
to O
send O
in O
my O
computer O
, O
they O
paid O
postage O
and O
whatnot O
, O
but O
when O
i O
got O
my O
computer O
back O
it O
still O
wasn't O
running B
right O
, O
and O
now O
my O
cd O
drive B
wasn't O
reading O
anything O
! O

i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
was O
the O
worst O
laptop O
i've O
ever O
bought O
. O

but O
the O
screen B
size B
is O
not O
that O
bad O
for O
email O
and O
web B
browsing B
. O

once O
i O
removed O
all O
the O
software B
the O
laptop O
loads B
in O
<number> O
<number> O
seconds O
. O

on O
my O
powerbook O
g4 O
i O
would O
never O
use O
the O
trackpad B
i O
would O
use O
an O
external B
mouse B
because O
i O
didn't O
like O
the O
trackpad B
. O

this O
computer O
doesn't O
do O
that O
well O
with O
certain O
games B
it O
can't O
play O
some O
and O
it O
becomes O
too O
hot O
while O
playing O
games B
. O

obviously O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
features B
of O
any O
computer O
is O
the O
human B
interface B
. O

yeah O
, O
of O
course O
smarty O
pants O
fix O
it O
now O
software O
compared O
to O
the O
early O
<number> O
edition O
i O
did O
see O
inbuilt B
applications B
crashing O
and O
it O
prompted O
me O
to O
send O
the O
report O
to O
apple O
which O
i O
promptly O
did O
. O

the O
body B
is O
a O
bit O
cheaply O
made O
so O
it O
will O
be O
interesting O
to O
see O
how O
long O
it O
holds O
up O
. O

the O
i5 B
blows O
my O
desktop O
out O
of O
the O
water O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
rendering O
videos O
. O

with O
a O
mac O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
antivirus B
software B
or O
firewall B
, O
it's O
so O
wonderful O
. O

for O
the O
use O
it O
was O
purchased O
for O
it O
is O
a O
good O
laptop O
. O

am O
very O
glad O
i O
bought O
it O
, O
great O
netbook O
, O
low O
price B
. O

obviously O
, O
this O
macbook O
is O
p O
e O
r O
f O
e O
c O
t O
for O
me O
because O
it O
does O
exactly O
what O
i O
need O
in O
an O
easy O
to O
function O
way O
. O

worth O
the O
investment O
and O
truly O
a O
fine O
piece O
of O
equipment O
. O

the O
apple O
team B
also O
assists O
you O
very O
nicely O
when O
choosing O
which O
computer O
is O
right O
for O
you O

summary O
dont O
buy O
hp O
. O

i O
think O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
with O
this O
computer O
is O
vista O
, O
yet O
i O
know O
vista O
isn't O
the O
entire O
issue O
because O
my O
latest O
purchase O
was O
my O
acer O
and O
it O
also O
has O
vista O
i O
should O
have O
waited O
the O
few O
months O
to O
get O
the O
next O
operating B
system B
. O

the O
video B
chat B
is O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
is O
iffy O
about O
it O
but O
im O
sure O
once O
they O
unpdate O
the O
next O
version O
on O
the O
macbook O
book O
the O
quality B
of O
it O
will O
be O
better O
. O

you'll O
need O
to O
upgrade O
and O
pay O
a O
little O
more O
for O
them O
. O

it O
is O
hard O
to O
fix O
and O
makes O
it O
a O
hassle O
to O
own O
one O
. O

that O
whole O
experience O
was O
just O
ridiculous O
we O
sent O
it O
in O
and O
after O
they O
told O
us O
that O
we O
had O
to O
pay O
<number> O
to O
fix O
it O
we O
were O
like O
we O
will O
just O
by O
a O
portable O
mouse B
which O
would O
be O
way O
cheaper O
but O
they O
refused O
to O
send O
the O
laptop O
back O
until O
we O
paid O
the O
<number> O
and O
it O
was O
fixed O
. O

macs O
are O
designed O
for O
the O
frontal O
lobe O
challenged O
people O
out O
there O
. O

fan O
vents O
to O
the O
side O
, O
so O
no O
cooling B
pad B
needed O
, O
great O
feature B
! O

i O
use O
my O
mac O
all O
the O
time O
, O
i O
love O
the O
software B
, O
the O
way O
it O
takes O
a O
short O
time O
to O
load O
things O
, O
how O
easy O
it O
is O
to O
use O
and O
most O
of O
all O
how O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
viruses O
. O

wasted O
me O
at O
least O
<number> O
hours O
of O
installation B
time B
. O

it O
has O
far O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
for O
power B
, O
storage B
, O
and O
abilitiy B
. O

a O
great O
feature B
is O
the O
spotlight B
search B
one O
can O
search B
for O
documents O
by O
simply O
typing O
a O
keyword O
, O
rather O
than O
parsing O
tens O
of O
file O
folders O
for O
a O
document O
. O

my O
wireless B
system B
would O
not O
recognize O
windows O
<number> O
and O
i O
couldn't O
get O
online O
to O
find O
out O
why O
. O

i O
am O
enjoying O
it O
and O
the O
quality B
it O
provides O
is O
great O
! O

it O
is O
the O
worst O
laptop O
ever O

suffice O
it O
to O
say O
, O
my O
macbook O
pro O
keeps O
me O
going O
with O
its O
long O
battery B
life B
and O
blazing O
speed B
. O

i'm O
not O
going O
to O
lie O
, O
i've O
never O
really O
liked O
the O
acer O
brand O
in O
general O
. O

the O
os O
is O
also O
very O
user O
friendly O
, O
even O
for O
those O
that O
switch O
from O
a O
pc O
, O
with O
a O
little O
practice O
you O
can O
take O
full O
advantage O
of O
this O
os O
! O

itunes O
is O
a O
handy O
music O
management O
program B
, O
and O
it O
is O
essential O
for O
anyone O
with O
an O
ipod O
. O

i O
give O
up O
on O
my O
data O
, O
i O
just O
want O
a O
computer O
reasonably O
fast O
. O
. O
. O

would O
buy O
<number> O
more O
of O
these O
if O
i O
could O
. O

while O
it O
was O
barely O
a O
bargin O
in O
the O
begining O
, O
i O
would O
never O
purchase O
another O
dell O
and O
would O
not O
recomend O
the O
dell O
brand O
to O
others O
. O

it O
was O
shooting O
sparks O
! O

great O
product O
. O

mac O
is O
not O
made O
for O
gaming B
. O

well O
i O
spilled O
something O
on O
it O
and O
they O
replaced O
it O
with O
this O
model O
, O
which O
gets O
hot O
and O
the O
battery B
doesn't O
make O
it O
through O
<number> O
dvd O
. O

i've O
had O
to O
call O
apple O
support B
to O
set O
up O
my O
new O
printer O
and O
have O
had O
wonderful O
experiences O
with O
helpful O
, O
english O
speaking O
from O
vancouver O
techs B
that O
walked O
me O
through O
the O
processes O
to O
help O
me O
. O

but O
sony O
said O
we O
could O
send O
it O
back O
and O
be O
charged O
for O
adding B
the B
bluetooth B
an O
additional O
seventy O
something O
dollars O
. O

by O
this O
time O
i O
was O
regretting O
ever O
seeing O
this O
machine O
on O
the O
shelf O
! O

toshiba O
is O
a O
great O
brand O
, O
even O
though O
i O
haven't O
had O
it O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
i O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
! O

i O
need O
graphic B
power B
to O
run O
my O
adobe O
creative O
apps B
efficiently O
. O

the O
programs B
are O
esay O
to O
use B
and O
are O
quick O
to O
process O
this O
computer O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

the O
materials B
that O
came O
with O
the O
computer O
did O
not O
include O
the O
right O
anywhere O
. O

so O
when O
you O
do O
call O
to O
complain O
about O
the O
hunk O
of O
metal O
you O
get O
the O
joy O
of O
speaking O
with O
a O
bunch O
of O
people O
you O
cant O
understand O
. O

that O
day O
! O

for O
one O
, O
i O
noticed O
that O
from O
turning O
on O
my O
mac O
to O
logging O
on O
only O
took O
about O
<number> O
seconds O
. O

it O
does O
not O
even O
have O
the O
software B
to O
play O
a O
dvd O
now O
. O

my O
brother O
is O
a O
computer O
wiz O
and O
would O
laugh O
at O
me O
because O
he O
used O
an O
apple O
. O

tech O
support B
tells O
me O
the O
latter O
problem O
is O
a O
power B
supply B
problem O
and O
have O
offered O
to O
fix O
it O
if O
it O
happens O
again O
. O

since O
i O
never O
really O
got O
to O
use O
this O
, O
i O
can't O
comment O
on O
anything O
except O
what O
went O
wrong O
after O
trying O
<number> O
of O
them O
. O

buyers O
beware O
. O

how O
does O
the O
power O
supply O
not O
work O
! O
! O
! O

sells O
for O
the O
same O
as O
a O
netbook O
without O
sacrificing O
size B
. O

i'll O
rather O
be O
out O
of O
date O
then O
spend O
more O
money O
on O
toshiba O
. O

upon O
giving O
them O
the O
serial O
number O
the O
first O
thing O
i O
was O
told O
, O
was O
that O
it O
was O
out O
of O
warranty B
and O
i O
could O
pay O
to O
have O
it O
repaired O
. O

windows O
xp O
sp2 O
caused O
many O
problems O
on O
the O
computer O
, O
so O
i O
had O
to O
remove O
it O
. O

love O
it O
. O

i O
reloaded O
with O
windows O
<number> O
ultimate O
, O
and O
the O
bluetooth O
and O
fingerprint O
reader B
software B
would O
not O
load O
. O

none O
of O
the O
techs B
at B
hp O
knew O
what O
they O
were O
doing O
. O

oh O
, O
it O
is O
such O
a O
great O
piece O
of O
equipment O
. O

this O
is O
my O
second O
one O
and O
the O
same O
problem O
, O
bad O
video B
card B
unreliable O
overall O
, O
this O
will O
be O
my O
second O
time O
returning O
this O
laptop O
back O
to O
best O
buy O
. O

i O
use O
that O
alot O
on O
my O
desktop O
, O
so O
i O
am O
adjusting O
to O
not O
having O
it O
. O

with O
awesome O
graphics B
and O
assuring O
security B
, O
it's O
perfect O
! O

laptop O
was O
in O
new O
condition O
and O
operational O
, O
but O
for O
the O
audio B
problem O
when O
1st O
sent O
for O
repair O
. O

i O
was O
disappointed O
when O
i O
realized O
that O
the O
keyboard B
doesn't O
light O
up O
on O
this O
model O
. O

this O
machine O
was O
a O
horrible O
experience O
. O

it O
runs B
perfectly O
. O

very O
dissappointed O
becase O
i O
have O
had O
toshibas O
for O
years O
, O
and O
never O
a O
issue O
. O

if O
you O
have O
any O
creativity O
in O
you O
do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
get O
a O
mac O
! O

the O
laptop O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
set B
up B
. O

congratulations O
asus O
for O
creating O
one O
big O
piece O
of O
dump O
which O
is O
my O
laptop O
. O

sometimes O
the O
screen B
even O
goes O
black O
on O
this O
computer O
. O

i O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
checking O
out O
this O
laptop O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
market O
for O
one O
. O

i O
recommend O
for O
word B
processing B
and O
internet B
users O
. O

since O
i've O
had O
this O
computer O
i've O
only O
used O
the O
trackpad B
because O
it O
is O
so O
nice O
and O
smooth O
. O

when O
the O
computer O
has O
been O
on O
for O
several O
minutes O
, O
it O
will O
occasionaly O
just O
go O
off O
by O
itself O
. O

a O
longer O
battery B
life B
would O
have O
been O
great O
but O
it O
meets O
it's O
spec B
quite O
easily O
. O

who O
couldn't O
love O
a O
dvd O
burner B
, O
<number> O
gigabyte O
hd O
, O
and O
fairly O
new O
graphics B
chip B
? O
as O
i O
soon O
discovered O
, O
though O
, O
there O
is O
a O
reason O
for O
which O
similarly O
configured O
sony O
and O
toshiba O
machines O
cost O
more O
they O
use O
higher O
quality O
components B
that O
are O
faster O
, O
better O
configured O
, O
and O
end O
up O
lasting O
a O
lot O
longer O
. O

falls O
into O
the O
case O
. O

this O
is O
something O
i O
would O
deffinately O
reccomend O
to O
someone O
. O

its O
fast O
and O
another O
thing O
i O
like O
is O
that O
it O
has O
three O
usb O
ports B
. O

mac O
computers O
automatically O
defrag O
each O
time O
you O
start O
your O
computer O
. O

that O
is O
my O
only O
complaint O
! O

the O
salesman O
talked O
us O
into O
this O
computer O
away O
from O
another O
we O
were O
looking O
at O
and O
we O
have O
had O
nothing O
but O
problems O
with O
software B
problems O
and O
just O
not O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

that O
system B
is O
fixed O
. O

the O
computer O
itself O
was O
fast O
, O
ran B
smoothly O
, O
and O
had O
no O
problems O
. O

one O
of O
the O
smartest O
thing O
i O
did O
was O
take O
my O
time O
to O
compare O
laptops O
before O
making O
my O
purchase O
. O

like O
the O
price B
and O
operation B
. O

the O
brand B
is O
tarnished O
in O
my O
heart O
. O

this O
is O
likely O
due O
to O
poor O
grounding O
and O
isolation O
between O
the O
components B
, O
and O
i'm O
hoping O
that O
it O
can O
be O
fixed O
with O
a O
ground B
loop B
isolator B
, O
but O
i O
still O
expected O
better O
product O
quality B
for O
this O
price B
range B
. O

honestly O
, O
this O
is O
absolutely O
wonderful O
. O

i O
'have O
had O
it O
for O
about O
a O
<number> O
<number> O
<number> O
and O
yes O
i O
have O
had O
an O
issue O
with O
it O
one O
month O
out O
of O
warranty B
. O

i O
really O
wish O
i O
had O
done O
this O
years O
ago O
. O

well O
, O
maybe O
i O
was O
just O
very O
unlucky O
. O

for O
example O
, O
when O
my O
husband O
turns O
the O
light O
out O
while O
i'm O
on O
the O
computer O
. O

once O
open O
, O
the O
leading B
edge B
is O
razor O
sharp O
. O

loaded O
with O
bloatware B
. O

if O
you O
buy O
, O
pray O
you O
dont O
have O
major O
prolems O
. O

don't O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
i O
am O
no O
microsoft O
hater O
, O
i've O
just O
managed O
to O
turn O
into O
a O
much O
bigger O
apple O
fan O
because O
of O
this O
machine O
. O

hp O
refused O
to O
give O
me O
a O
new O
one O
and O
wal O
mart O
refused O
to O
take O
it O
back O
. O

within O
<number> O
weeks O
the O
same O
issues O
started O
happening O
again O
. O

maximum O
sound B
isn't O
nearly O
as O
loud O
as O
it O
should O
be O
. O

well O
, O
they O
don't O
care O
a O
bunch O
. O

i O
loaded O
windows B
<number> O
via O
bootcamp O
and O
it O
works O
flawlessly O
! O

i O
have O
never O
had O
to O
shut O
down O
the O
computer O
unexpectedly O
and O
the O
computer O
has O
never O
froze O
on O
me O
. O

great O
laptop O
for O
the O
price B
, O
works B
well O
with O
action B
pack B
games B
. O

although O
the O
price B
is O
higher O
then O
dell O
laptops O
, O
the O
macbooks O
are O
worth O
the O
dough O
. O

recommended O
to O
people O
as O
their O
first O
laptop O
. O

i O
would O
recomend O
this O
acer O
to O
parents O
and O
grandparents O
it O
can O
really O
help O
them O
in O
school O
. O

i O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
wanting O
a O
notebook O
expecting O
the O
performance B
of O
a O
desktop O
it O
does O
not O
meet O
the O
expectations O
. O

the O
macbook O
arrived O
in O
a O
nice O
twin B
packing B
and O
sealed O
in O
the O
box O
, O
all O
the O
functions B
works O
great O
. O

so O
what O
if O
the O
laptops O
mobile O
phones O
look B
chic O
and O
cool O
? O
the O
after B
sales B
support B
is O
terrible O
. O

they O
have O
not O
sent O
a O
new O
one O
nor O
called O
. O

i O
would O
easly O
reccomend O
this O
laptop O
to O
a O
friend O
. O

i O
hate O
the O
display B
screen B
and O
i O
have O
done O
everything O
i O
could O
do O
the O
change O
it O
. O

i O
spent O
alot O
of O
money O
on O
this O
product O
and O
its O
been O
a O
nightmare O
. O

i O
also O
like O
the O
acer B
arcade B
but O
these O
were O
reallythe O
only O
two O
things O
i O
liked O
about O
this O
laptop O
. O

have O
not O
yet O
needed O
any O
customer B
support B
with O
this O
yet O
so O
to O
me O
that O
is O
a O
great O
thing O
, O
which O
is O
leaps O
and O
bounds O
ahead O
of O
pc O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

thinking O
about O
returning O
it O

i O
gave O
it O
to O
my O
daughter O
because O
i O
just O
hated O
the O
screen B
, O
hated O
that O
it O
had O
no O
cd B
drive B
to O
at O
least O
play O
cd's O
when O
i O
wanted O
to O
listen O
to O
music O
and O
do O
schoolwork O
. O

it O
runs B
very O
quiet O
too O
which O
is O
a O
plus O
. O

but O
it O
has O
a O
major O
design B
flaw O
. O

i O
took O
the O
laptop O
home O
and O
not O
even O
a O
month O
later O
, O
i O
began O
to O
have O
problems O
with O
it O
. O

it O
was O
heavy O
, O
bulky O
, O
and O
hard O
to O
carry O
because O
of O
the O
size B
. O

that O
was O
my O
first O
apple O
product O
and O
since O
then O
i O
have O
been O
incredibly O
happy O
with O
every O
product O
of O
theirs O
i O
have O
bought O
. O

i O
tried O
turning O
it O
done O
but O
it O
did O
nothing O
. O

it O
is O
super O
fast O
, O
and O
always O
loads O
. O

the O
games B
included O
are O
very O
good O
games B
. O

this O
computer O
will O
last O
you O
at O
least O
<number> O
years O
, O
thats O
an O
amazing O
life B
spanned O
an O
electronic O
. O

i O
bought O
mine O
from O
apple O
store O
the O
day O
it O
was O
released O
as O
amazon O
didn't O
have O
it O
yet O
. O

i O
had O
something O
else O
go O
wrong O
and O
they O
said O
it O
had O
to O
be O
in O
good O
working O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
buy O
the O
warranty B
. O

the O
whole O
experiece O
is O
horrible O
so O
save O
up O
and O
buy O
a O
better O
laptop O
. O

i O
just O
bought O
this O
laptop O
<number> O
days O
ago O
. O

i O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
my O
purchase O
! O

sometimes O
you O
really O
have O
to O
tap O
the O
pad B
to O
get O
it O
to O
worki O

it's O
super O
fast O
and O
a O
great O
value B
for O
the O
price B
! O

three O
, O
the O
mac O
book O
has O
advantages O
over O
pcs' O
with O
linux B
based B
os B
there O
is O
very O
'few O
problems O
with O
system B
performance B
when O
it O
comes O
to O
a O
mac O
. O

a O
mac O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use B
and O
it O
simply O
makes O
sense O
. O

of O
course O
, O
emachines O
cannot O
be O
made O
entirely O
to O
blame O
for O
this O
computer's O
woes O
; O

however O
, O
i O
may O
have O
inadvertently O
thrown O
out O
one O
of O
the O
batteries B
with O
the O
shipping B
carton B
. O

love O
it O
so O
far O
. O

it O
is O
so O
much O
easier O
to O
use B

there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
open O
a O
program B
first O
and O
the O
cliick O
open O
or O
import O
. O

in O
short O
, O
you O
could O
say O
your O
mac O
could O
become O
your O
best O
friend O
no O
intention O
of O
replacing O
rover O
your O
dog O
. O

it O
was O
a O
bad O
experience O
but O
i O
played O
down O
its O
importance O
. O

meets O
my O
needs O
perfectly O
and O
is O
light O
enough O
for O
this O
senior O
to O
carry O
without O
affecting O
my O
arthritis O
. O

it O
is O
so O
nice O
not O
to O
worry O
about O
that O
and O
the O
extra O
expense O
that O
comes O
along O
with O
the O
necessary O
virus B
protection B
on O
pc's O
. O

the O
notebook O
pc O
, O
toshiba O
qosmio O
is O
the O
best O
gift O
my O
father O
could O
have O
ever O
gotten O
me O
. O

three O
weeks O
after O
i O
bought O
the O
netbook O
, O
the O
screen B
quit O
working O
. O

the O
processor B
screams O
, O
and O
because O
of O
the O
unique O
way O
that O
apple O
osx O
<number> O
functions O
, O
most O
of O
the O
graphics B
are O
routed O
through O
the O
hardware B
rather O
than O
the O
software B
. O

i O
am O
currently O
out O
of O
town O
and O
called O
to O
inform O
them O
the O
broken O
part O
would O
be O
returned O
when O
i O
got O
back O
in O
town O
. O

returned O
laptop O
for O
a O
4th O
repair O
and O
it O
came O
back O
but O
now O
would O
lock O
up O
and O
randomly O
reboot O
frequently O
making O
the O
laptop O
unusable O
. O

i O
wanted O
something O
that O
had O
a O
new O
intel O
core O
processors B
and O
hdmi O
port B
so O
that O
we O
could O
hook O
it O
up O
directly O
to O
our O
tv O
. O

the O
apple O
will O
run O
internet O
explorer O
, O
but O
at O
an O
amazingly O
slow O
rate O
. O

with O
today's O
company O
fighting O
over O
marketshare O
, O
its O
a O
shame O
that O
asus O
can O
get O
away O
with O
the O
inept O
staff B
answering O
thephone O
. O

other O
than O
that O
i O
don't O
have O
one O
complaint O
in O
the O
world O
! O

the O
computer O
is O
so O
slow O
, O
even O
after O
paying O
staples O
the O
extra O
money O
to O
speed O
it O
up O
. O

i O
feel O
that O
enough O
people O
have O
macs O
these O
days O
and O
that O
companies O
need O
to O
start O
making O
things O
more O
compatable O
than O
they O
used O
to O
be O
. O

the O
price B
premium B
is O
a O
little O
much O
, O
but O
when O
you O
start O
looking O
at O
the O
features B
it O
is O
worth O
the O
added O
cash O
. O

<number> O
weeks O
after O
giving O
the O
computer O
for O
repair O
apple O
offers O
to O
send O
replacement O
after O
they O
receive O
the O
old O
computer O
. O

i O
can't O
say O
enough O
of O
how O
satisfied O
i O
am O
with O
their O
product B
and B
help B
aftermarket B
. O

my O
computer O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
in O
the O
school O
compared O
to O
my O
fellow O
classmates O
. O

i O
bought O
for O
my O
son O
in O
the O
2nd O
grade O
. O

this O
has O
happened O
three O
times O
so O
far O
. O

i'm O
a O
professional O
consultant O
, O
and O
a O
client O
needed O
work O
on O
her O

. O

compresses O

. O

microsoft O

i O

don't O
have O

boot B
up B
or O
shut B
down B
and O
all O
the O

it O

very O
easy O

not O
take O
long O
to O
get O

a O
value O

i O
took O
it O
back O

it O
is O
well O
worth O
the O
money O
it O
cost B

very O
good O
investment O

upgrading O

this O

had O
exactly O
the O
specifications B
i O
needed O
. O

overall O
, O
still O
a O
very O
nice O
machine O
. O

where O
you O
click O

my O
kids O
and O

destroyed O
two O
power B
cords B
by O
pulling O
on O
them O
. O

i O
had O
upgraded O
my O
old O
macbook O
to O
lion O
, O
so O
i O
kind O
of O
knew O
what O
i O
was O
getting O
, O
but O
hadn't O
been O
able O
to O
enjoy O
some O
of O
the O
awesome O
new O
multi O
touch O
features B
. O

i O
had O
this O
computer O
for O
one O
month O
and O
had O
to O
send O
it O
in O
for O
repair O
. O

the O
screen B
is O
a O
little O
glary O
, O
and O
i O
hated O
the O
clicking B
buttons B
, O
but O
i O
got O
used O
to O
them O
. O

not O
to O
mention O
, O
the O
battery B
life B
is O
absolutely O
amazing O
. O

i O
realize O
that O
not O
every O
unit O
has O
this O
issue O
, O
but O
the O
ones O
that O
do O
cannot O
be O
repaired O
. O

i O
have O
had O
a O
mac O
for O
<number> O
years O
and O
won't O
go O
back O
to O
pc O
. O

i O
love O
to O
use O
it O
it O
is O
esay O
and O
light O
. O

windows O
also O
shuts O
the O
computer O
down O
for O
no O
reason O
without O
warning O
. O

not O
using O
wired B
lan B
not O
sure O
what O
thats O
about O
. O

after O
about O
another O
month O
i O
had O
to O
send O
it O
in O
again O
to O
acer O
for O
repairs O
. O

the O
macbook O
rarely O
requires O
a O
hard B
reboot B
. O

i O
love O
it O
! O

the O
<number> O
reason O
that O
is O
always O
repeated O
. O

now O
for O
the O
hardware B
problems O
. O

unfortunately O
, O
that O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O

anyways O
i O
bought O
this O
two O
months O
ago O
and O
when O
i O
first O
brought O
it O
home O
it O
kept O
giving O
me O
a O
message O
about O
a O
vibration O
in O
the O
hard B
drive B
and O
it O
is O
putting O
it O
temporaly O
in O
save O
zone O
. O

it's O
fast O
and O
has O
excellent O
battery B
life B
. O

it's O
face O
and O
depanable O
. O

no O
viruses O
! O

i'm O
just O
really O
happy O
that O
i O
waited O
to O
buy O
, O
because O
this O
thing O
kicks O
a O
! O

the O
hewitt O
packard O
pavillion O
dv6700 O
was O
my O
first O
laptop O
, O
before O
this O
i O
had O
a O
dell O
desktop O
that O
i O
loved O
. O

apple O
care B
included O
. O

it O
was O
an O
all O
around O
waste O
of O
money O
for O
me O
. O

i O
worked O
in O
it O
retail O
sales O
before O
. O

features O
like O
the O
font B
are O
very O
block O
like O
and O
old O
school O
. O

it O
has O
everything O
you O
need O
to O
get O
the O
job O
done O
. O

it O
is O
loaded O
with O
programs B
that O
is O
of O
no O
good O
for O
the O
average O
user O
, O
that O
makes O
it O
run B
way O
to O
slow O
. O

i O
feel O
that O
it O
was O
poorly O
put O
together O
, O
because O
once O
in O
a O
while O
different O
plastic O
pieces O
would O
come O
off O
of O
it O
. O

it O
cant O
fuction O
well O
with O
lots O
of O
webpages O
open O
at O
once O
. O

finally O
, O
i O
should O
note O
that O
i O
took O
the O
2gb O
ram O
stick B
from O
my O
old O
eeepc O
and O
installed O
it O
before O
i O
even O
powered O
on O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

this O
laptop O
has O
left O
me O
with O
a O
horrible O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth O
for O
acer O
brand O
products O
. O

its O
not O
bad O
just O
very O
very O
annoying O
. O

well O
, O
maybe O
more O
like O
week O
one O
. O

windows O
is O
also O
rather O
unsteady O
on O
its O
feet O
and O
is O
susceptible O
to O
many O
bugs O
. O

after O
sending O
out O
documents O
via O
email O
and O
having O
recipients O
tell O
me O
they O
could O
not O
open O
the O
documents O
or O
they O
came O
through O
as O
gibberish O
, O
i O
broke O
down O
and O
spent O
another O
<number> O
to O
get O
microsoft O
word O
for B
mac O
. O

i O
believe O
i O
purchased O
this O
in O
dec O
<number> O
for O
my O
primary O
work O
laptop O
which O
is O
used O
<number> O
<number> O
hours O
a O
day O
, O
<number> O
<number> O
days O
a O
week O
. O

do O
not O
buy O
gateway O
computers O
they O
are O
junk O
and O
the O
warranty O
company O
is O
horrible O
. O

then O
on O
top O
of O
it O
all O
their O
cusromer B
service B
center B
is O
in O
the O
middle O
east O
. O

the O
only O
bad O
part O
is O
the O
size B
weight B
. O

the O
little O
battery B
that O
it O
did O
have O
would O
only O
last O
about O
an O
hour O
while O
just O
having O
it O
on O
the O
desktop O
. O

i O
liked O
the O
aluminum B
body B
. O

also O
it O
is O
light O
weight O
compared O
to O
others O
. O

its O
good O
for O
playing B
my O
apps O
on O
facebook O
or O
watching B
movies B
. O

from O
the O
build B
quality B
to O
the O
performance B
, O
everything O
about O
it O
has O
been O
sub O
par O
from O
what O

great O

costing B
less O
than O
one O
thousand O
bucks O
before O
tax O
. O

waiting O
for O
the O

. O

i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
on O
saturday O
and O
am O
completely O
in O
love O
with O
it O
! O

i O
asked O

they O
would O
determine O
that O
since O
there O
are O
no O
scratches O
, O
dents O
or O
other O
signs O
of O
damage O
and O
was O
told O
that O
was O
the O
only O
way O
this O
type O
of O
damage O
could O
happen O
. O

now O
, O
, O
, O
, O
, O
my O
monitor B
has O
been O
acting O
up O
for O
about O
<number> O
months O

a O
problem O

beautiful O
! O

buy O

and O
i O
promise O
you O
won't O

i O
needed O

for O
my O
hp O
and O
they O
would O
not O
help O
me O
with O
out O
me O
paying O
over O
<number> O
for O
it O
. O

if O
you O
don't O
like O
fingerprints O
, O
this O
might O
not O
be O
the O
laptop O
for O
you O
. O

call O
tech B
support B
, O
standard O
email O
the O
form O
and O
fax O
it O
back O
in O
to O
us O
. O

just O
a O
month O
and O
a O
half O
or O
two O
months O
ago O
, O
my O
vaio O
crashed O
again O
. O

they O
sent O
it O
back O
with O
a O
huge O
crack O
in O
it O
and O
it O
still O
didn't O
work B
. O

a O
coupla O
months O
later O
, O
they O
change O
my O
hard B
drive B
. O

i O
did O
contact O
hp O
and O
share O
how O
unhappy O
i O
am O
. O

the O
macbook O
arrived O
in O
a O
nice O
twin B
packing B
and O
sealed O
in O
the O
box O
, O
all O
the O
functions B
works O
great O
. O

the O
<number> O
macbook O
pro O
is O
portable O
, O
durable O
, O
and O
very O
capable O
. O

i O
should O
have O
spent O
an O
extra O
hundred O
bucks O
and O
got O
a O
full O
sized O
computer O
. O

great O
overall O
. O

my O
smart O
phone O
is O
faster O
! O

they O
say O
sorry O
out O
of O
warranty B
. O

i O
have O
full O
control O
at O
all O
times O
of O
what O
is O
going O
on O
there O
is O
no O
control O
alt O
delete O
business O
anymore O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
because O
of O
the O
performance B
to O
price B
ratio O
. O

pc O
never O
worked O
right O
even O
after O
bios O
fixed O
. O

after O
having O
two O
pc O
laptops O
die O
with O
in O
the O
past O
<number> O
years O
, O
i O
was O
led O
to O
the O
apple O
display O
at O
best O
buy O
by O
the O
sleek O
design B
and O
promise O
of O
less O
tech B
issues B
. O

i O
have O
a O
laptop O
as O
my O
regular O
computer O
, O
but O
found O
that O
disconnecting O
it O
and O
lugging O
it O
around O
was O
a O
drag O
. O

this O
is O
my O
second O
macbook O
. O

the O
size B
is O
perfect O
and O
i O
do O
not O
recomend O
anything O
bigger O
except O
for O
any O
person O
who O
can O
exceed O
the O
limited O
space B
it O
gives O
you O
. O

the O
service B
i O
received O
from O
toshiba O
went O
above O
and O
beyond O
the O
call O
of O
duty O
. O

have O
had O
many O
higher O
priced B
computers O
crash O
and O
burn O
long O
before O
ever O
got O
to O
use O
all O
that O
great O
memory B
and O
speed B
, O
etc O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
it O
just O
because O
of O
the O
internet B
speed B
probably O
because O
thats O
the O
only O
thing O
i O
really O
care O
about O
. O

i O
own O
other O
macs O
but O
always O
find O
myself O
navigation O
to O
the O
macbook O
pro O
to O
get O
my O
work O
done O
. O

there O
are O
several O
programs B
for O
school B
or B
office B
use B
pages O
, O
numbers O
, O
keynote O
, O
etc O
. O
, O
music B
garageband O
, O
photo B
management B
photo B
booth O
, O
iphoto O
, O
video O
editing O
or B
movie O
making O
imovie O
, O
etc O
. O

this O
is O
my O
3rd O
apple O
laptop O
and O
first O
macbook O
pro O
. O

i O
have O
had O
this O
laptop O
for O
a O
few O
months O
now O
and O
i O
would O
say O
im O
pretty O
satisfied O
. O

the O
love O
part O
of O
my O
relationship O
with O
this O
laptop O
doesn't O
take O
very O
long O
. O

not O
enough O
time O
for O
me O
to O
give O
it O
<number> O
stars O
! O

the O
screen B
shows O
great O
colors B
. O

reason O
why O
? O
it's O
because O
when O
you O
buy O
it O
, O
you O
know O
first O
thing O
that O
you O
will O
not O
lose O
any O
value B
for O
that O
laptop O
, O
the O
price B
will O
stay O
the O
same O
for O
the O
next O
year O
, O
and O
even O
if O
apple O
does O
decides O
to O
change O
mode O
, O
your O
laptop O
value B
will O
only O
drop O
<number> O
<number> O
, O
unlike O
pc O
laptops O
which O
drop O
more O
than O
<number> O
. O

that's O
a O
huge O
difference O
. O

dells O
are O
ok O
, O
hps O
aren't O
that O
good O
, O
but O
macs O
or O
fantastic O
. O

so O
, O
buyers O
beware O
! O

i O
am O
totally O
satisfied O
with O
my O
little O
toshie O
! O

i O
have O
no O
idea O
how O
to O
burn B
cd's B
or O
to O
use O
the O
web B
cam B
, O
just O
for O
starters O
. O

again O
, O
i O
sent O
it O
off O
to O
acer O
, O
by O
this O
time O
they O
were O
paying O
for O
me O
to O
send O
it O
to O
them O
and O
everything O
, O
but O
it O
was O
still O
inconvienent O
because O
of O
my O
classes O
and O
my O
communication O
with O
my O
fiance O
. O

definitely O
recommended O
! O
! O
! O

it O
is O
extremely O
user O
friendly O
and O
intuitive O
. O

let O
me O
start O
with O
the O
good O
so O
awesome O
. O

i O
had O
finally O
reached O
my O
limit O
and O
broke O
down O
. O

the O
<number> O
inch B
screen B
is O
very O
large O
, O
but O
the O
computer O
is O
very O
light O
. O

my O
opinion O
of O
sony O
has O
been O
dropping O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
stock O
market O
, O
given O
their O
horrible O
support B
, O
but O
this O
machine O
just O
caused O
another O
plunge O
. O

do O
i O
like O
the O
computer O
? O
well O
, O
other O
than O
not O
getting O
viruses O
, O
i O
guess O
it O
is O
ok O
. O

for O
the O
bluetooth O
to O
work O
properly O
, O
you O
must O
install O
the O
launch O
manager O
on O
the O
drivers O
applications O
dvd O
, O
or O
it O
will O
not O
show O
after O
the O
reload O
. O

i O
waited O
and O
waited O
and O
no O
laptop O
. O

everything O
is O
falling O
apart O
internally O
and O
externally O
. O

i O
also O
liked O
the O
glass B
screen B
. O

the O
switchable B
graphic B
card B
is O
pretty O
sweet O
when O
you O
want O
gaming B
on O
the O
laptop O
. O

it O
super O
shiny O
, O
so O
you O
can O
see O
the O
fingerprints O
easily O
. O

it's O
not O
a O
wear O
and O
tear O
issue O
, O
not O
due O
to O
user O
carelessness O
and O
most O
importantly O
, O
they O
can't O
guarantee O
the O
problem O
will O
be O
solved O
if O
it O
is O
sent O
for O
service B
and O
i O
have O
to O
accept O
the O
outcome O
. O

the O
battery B
life B
has O
not O
decreased O
since O
i O
bought O
it O
, O
so O
i'm O
thrilled O
with O
that O
. O

its O
a O
dog O
plain O
and O
simple O
. O

when O
i O
called O
toshiba O
, O
they O
would O
not O
do O
anything O
and O
even O
tried O
to O
charge O
me O
<number> O
for O
the O
phone O
call O
, O
even O
though O
they O
didn't O
offer O
any O
technical B
support B
. O

my O
hp O
is O
very O
heavy O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
notebook O
and O
only O
had O
it O
for O
<number> O
months O
if O
it O
is O
overload O
with O
updates O
the O
boot O
mgr O
. O

oh O
and O
if O
thats O
not O
bad O
enough O
it O
doesn't O
come O
with O
a O
recovery B
cd B
so O
you O
can O
make O
one O
if O
you O
know O
how O
to O
or O
buy O
one O
if O
you O
buy O
it O
the O
cost O
is O
<number> O
for O
two O
cds O
. O

the O
price B
and O
features B
more O
than O
met O
my O
needs O
. O

they O
refuse O
. O

big O
mistake O
! O

best O
buy O
was O
great O
as O
always O
and O
accepted O
the O
return O
and O
gave O
me O
another O
model O
<number> O
. O

and O
dell O
and O
best O
buy O
both O
refused O
to O
take O
it O
back O
after O
i O
only O
had O
it O
for O
<number> O
hour O
. O
. O
. O
. O

my O
friends O
or O
children O
use O
that O
when O
they O
need O
to O
borrow O
the O
net O
when O
i O
out O
grow O
this O
meaning O
when O
its O
old O
and O
my O
oldest O
child O
is O
ready O
for O
one O
she O
will O
get O
this O
one O
and O
i O
will O
be O
buying O
only O
toshiba O
! O

first O
of O
all O
, O
i've O
been O
dell O
fan O
for O
more O
than O
fifteen O
years O
. O

great O
investment O
! O

i O
am O
just O
amazed O
. O

i O
burned O
my O
leg O
, O
after O
lifting O
it O
from O
my O
desk O
, O
and O
for O
less O
than O
<number> O
second O
putting O
it O
on O
my O
lap O
to O
clean O
my O
coffee O
table O
, O
so O
i O
can O
place O
it O
there O
. O

i O
thought O
all O
my O
problems O
would O
finally O
be O
solved O
being O
that O
my O
old O
computer O
wouldn't O
go O
onto O
our O
wireless O
network O
and O
i O
wouldn't O
have O
the O
same O
problems O
because O
it O
was O
updated O
. O

skype O
is O
just O
so O
dang O
cool O
with O
this O
machine O
too O
. O

i O
would O
buy O
this O
lap O
top O
over O
and O
over O
again O
! O

the O
mouse B
buttons B
are O
hard O
to O
push O
. O

i O
can O
actually O
get O
work O
done O
with O
this O
mac O
, O
and O
not O
fight O
with O
it O
like O
my O
tired O
old O
pc O
laptop O
. O

also O
, O
hdd O
secures O
inside O
using O
rails B
, O
and O
there O
is O
only O
one O
set O
on O
the O
main O
hard B
drive B
. O

if O
you're O
not O
wanting O
to O
be O
mobile O
, O
this O
is O
a O
good O
laptop O
to O
sit O
on O
a O
desk O
. O

i O
also O
travel O
with O
it O
and O
it O
never O
gives O
me O
any O
problems O
. O

just O
don't O
waste O
your O
time O
and O
money O
on O
this O
. O

all O
i O
will O
say O
now O
is O
that O
it O
was O
over O
two O
grand O
less O
expensive O
and O
so O
much O
better O
quality B
than O
my O
hunk O
of O
crap O
vaio O
. O

beware O
, O
their O
staff B
could O
send O
you O
back O
making O
you O
feel O
that O
only O
they O
know O
what O
a O
computer O
is O
. O

and O
i'm O
still O
paying O
the O
bloody O
financing O
, O
for O
a O
product O
which O
didn't O
last O
me O
at O
least O
three O
years O
! O

games O
being O
the O
main O
issue O
. O

no O
problems O
, O
no O
lock O
ups O
, O
no O
disappointments O
. O

while O
the O
computer O
seems O
to O
be O
set O
up O
in O
a O
common O
sense O
way O
rather O
than O
in O
geek O
speak O
, O
there O
are O
certain O
quirks O
that O
can O
drive O
you O
crazy O
trying O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
pc O
world O
. O

i O
am O
definitely O
sold O
, O
and O
not O
going O
back O
to O
pcs O
for O
home O
use O
! O

i O
have O
a O
lapdesk O
which O
i O
can O
use O
, O
but O
i O
can O
still O
feel O
the O
heat O
through O
the O
foam O
and O
plastic O
. O

and O
its O
really O
cheap O
and O
you O
wont O
regret O
buying O
it O
. O

it O
was O
over O
rated O
! O

i O
dont O
understand O
how O
anyone O
can O
think O
this O
is O
a O
great O
product O
worth O
purchasing O
. O

my O
sister O
has O
the O
same O
mac O
as O
me O
and O
she O
is O
in O
a O
band O
and O
uses O
garageband O
to O
record O
and O
edit O
. O

i O
wasn't O
really O
sure O
i O
wanted O
to O
spend O
that O
kind O
of O
money O
! O

other O
thoughts O
do O
not O
purchase O
this O
product O
. O

they O
say O
that O
this O
will O
invalidate O
the O
warranty B
on O
the O
hard B
drive B
i O
don't O
really O
understand O
why O
but O
anyway O
. O

and O
looks O
very O
sexyy O
d O
really O
the O
mac O
book O
pro O
is O
the O
best O
laptop O
specially O
for O
students O
in O
college O
if O
you O
are O
not O
caring O
about O
price B
. O

i O
took O
the O
computer O
back O
in O
yet O
again O
except O
this O
time O
they O
kept O
it O
to O
send O
into O
their O
geek O
squad O
headquarters O
. O

this O
is O
a O
great O
laptop O
and O
i O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
. O

thank O
god O
for O
ctrl O
z O
bottom O
line O
, O
i've O
been O
using O
laptops O
since O
the O
mid O
90s O
and O
probably O
the O
majority O
of O
brands O
out O
there O
. O

they O
definitely O
have O
a O
superior O
product O
! O

a O
great O
computer O
for O
light O
home B
use B
and O
business B
use B
. O

bought O
it O
to O
use O
mostly O
for O
oline O
classes O
. O

even O
with O
virus B
protection B
, O
it O
always O
turned O
off O
when O
updates B
were O
needed O
and O
installed O
. O

also O
consider O
the O
ms O
office O
apps B
are O
all O
trial O
versions O
, O
hope O
you O
have O
your O
own O
copies O
. O

they O
are O
wonderful O
, O
but O
very O
dangerous O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
emitting O
heat O
. O

this O
computer O
was O
awful O
! O

heck O
, O
if O
i O
had O
enough O
' O
money O
, O
i O
would O
but O
it O
as O
a O
gift O
for O
someone O
. O

even O
so O
, O
i O
like O
playing O
online O
games B
, O
so O
it O
was O
wonderful O
that O
there O
is O
a O
feature B
where O
i O
can O
dualboot O
windows O
. O

the O
battery B
life B
is O
amazingly O
long O
at O
7hrs O
and O
5hrs O
if O
you O
use O
it O
. O

my O
previous O
purchases O
were O
with O
dell O
and O
hp O
. O

i O
have O
not O
have O
any O
problems O
. O

i O
purchased O
an O
hp O
right O
after O
my O
high O
school O
graduation O
. O

me O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
bought O
the O
gateway O
nv78 O
in O
nov O
of O
<number> O
. O

it O
is O
very O
user O
friendly O
and O
not O
hard O
to O
figure O
out O
at O
all O
. O

lightweight O
, O
long O
battery B
life B
, O
excellent O
transition O
from O
pc O
; O

the O
price B
is O
another O
driving O
influence O
that O
made O
me O
purchase O
this O
laptop O
. O

the O
nortons O
virus B
scan B
is O
only O
for O
a O
very O
short O
time O
unlike O
others O
that O
usually O
are O
good O
for O
a O
year O
. O

it O
is O
stamped O
and O
not O
in O
pieces O
therefore O
it O
is O
a O
stronger O
more O
resilient O
frame B
. O

i O
am O
first O
time O
mac O
buyer O
and O
am O
amazed O
at O
features B
and O
ease O
of O
use B
the O
mac O
offers O
. O

two O
, O
owning O
a O
<number> O
in O
. O
mac O
book O
gives O
the O
flexibility O
to O
sit O
anywhere O
you O
want O
without O
worry O
about O
bother O
anyone O
. O

sent O
unit O
back O
and O
it's O
been O
two O
months O
. O

came O
fully O
loaded B
good O
. O

i O
noticed O
windows B
has O
a O
new O
system O
called O
windows B
<number> O
, O
what O
about O
us O
vista O
users O
? O
they O
should O
get O
all O
the O
bugs O
out O
of O
vista O
before O
investing O
in O
a O
new O
system O
. O

when O
we O
bought O
our O
new O
hp O
comouter O
in O
dec O
. O
of O
<number> O
, O
we O
wanted O
windows O
xp O
, O
but O
were O
told O
it O
would O
cost O
an O
extra O
<number> O
, O
so O
we O
went O
with O
vista O
. O

i O
definatly O
can't O
. O

files O
as O
well O
would O
become O
lost O
, O
deleted O
or O
corrupted O
. O

it O
is O
meant O
to O
be O
portable O
. O

my O
laptop O
worked O
again O
for O
just O
a O
while O
before O
i O
started O
having O
issues O
again O
. O

this O
is O
perfect O
for O
her O
field O
. O

taking O
it O
back O
less O
than O
<number> O
hours O
of O
purchase O

that's O
the O
downside O
for O
me O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
that O
i O
have O
, O
is O
the O
key B
broad B
is O
a O
little O
dark O
to O
see O
the O
letters O
, O
would O
help O
if O
it O
was O
a O
little O
lighter O
then O
it O
is O
. O

hopefully O
amazon O
will O
take O
this O
back O
. O

they O
ended O
up O
keeping O
my O
computer O
for O
almost O
<number> O
months O
! O

i'm O
still O
within O
the O
one O
year O
warranty B
but O
the O
repair B
depot O
has O
deemed O
that O
this O
time O
it O
was O
caused O
by O
physical O
abuse O
and O
is O
not O
covered O
. O

but O
i O
needed O
a O
laptop O
for O
school B
use B
. O

he O
can't O
stand O
it O
. O

the O
computer O
was O
delivered O
as O
promised O
. O

this O
is O
the O
complete O
opposite O
to O
an O
ergonomic O
design B
. O

i O
would O
like O
at O
least O
a O
<number> O
hr O
. O
battery B
life B
. O

the O
only O
thing O
that O
i O
don't O
like O
about O
my O
mac O
is O
that O
sometimes O
there O
are O
programs B
that O
i O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
run O
and O
i O
am O
not O
able O
to O
. O

looking O
online O
, O
many O
people O
are O
having O
the O
same O
problem O
. O

wireless O
has O
not O
been O
a O
issue O
for O
me O
, O
like O
some O
others O
have O
meantioned O
. O

this O
is O
my O
second O
mac O
book O
pro O
. O

macbook O
notebooks O
quickly O
die O
out O
because O
of O
their O
short O
battery B
life B
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
many O
background O
programs B
that O
run O
without O
the O
user's O
knowlede O
. O

all O
the O
things O
you O
can O
do O
with O
the O
trackpad B
make O
navigating B
around O
the O
computer O
and O
its O
programs B
so O
much O
simpler O
, O
quicker O
, O
and O
easier O
. O

i O
guess O
the O
only O
good O
thing O
that O
came O
out O
of O
these O
were O
the O
speakers B
and O
the O
subwoofer B
. O

theres O
a O
built B
in B
camera B
with O
special O
effects O
for O
video O
and O
photography O
. O

all O
for O
such O
a O
great O
price B
. O

i O
went O
right O
out O
and O
purchased O
another O
laptop O
. O

long O
story O
short O
, O
since O
i O
experience O
so O
many O
problems O
with O
my O
laptop O
every O
since O
i O
bought O
it O
from O
day O
one O
, O
i O
didn't O
ask O
for O
a O
new O
laptop O
or O
a O
refund O
of O
what O
i O
pay O
for O
a O
crapy O
laptop O
, O
but O
just O
an O
extension O
of O
my O
laptop O
warranty B
for O
another O
year O
, O
they O
made O
a O
big O
deal O
of O
out O
that O
and O
after O
so O
many O
calls O
and O
complaints O
about O
their O
products O
and O
services O
, O
they O
finally O
gave O
in O
. O

i O
am O
able O
to O
play O
720p O
and O
1080p O
media O
files O
just O
fine O
with O
it O
. O

i O
already O
own O
an O
iphone O
, O
and O
so O
the O
move O
just O
made O
more O
sense O
. O

so O
think O
about O
factoring O
those O
things O
in O
when O
you O
purchase O
. O

took O
the O
netbook O
on O
a O
vacation O
trip O
and O
i O
was O
able O
to O
do O
whatever O
i O
wanted O
to O
do O
without O
lugging O
a O
much O
heavier O
laptop O
. O

everything O
was O
up O
and O
running O
within O
<number> O
minutes O
of O
unboxing O
. O

this O
computer O
gets O
very O
hot O
, O
before O
shutting O
down O
. O

another O
thing O
is O
that O
after O
only O
a O
month O
the O
left B
mouse B
key B
broke O
and O
it O
costed B
<number> O
to O
send O
it O
in O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

went O
silently O
. O

satisfy O
what O
i O
paid O
for O
it O
. O

it O
is O
trash O
! O

it O
has O
good O
speed B
and O
plenty O
of O
hard B
drive B
space B
. O

clear O
picture B
on O
it O
and O
everything O
. O

overall O
though O
, O
for O
the O
money O
spent O
it's O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

so O
you O
don't O
get O
frustrated O
the O
first O
few O
weeks O
. O

they O
said O
that O
my O
computer O
was O
covered O
on O
an O
extended B
warranty B
, O
and O
that O
products O
with O
extended B
warranties B
are O
taken O
care O
of O
through O
third O
parties O
and O
not O
sony O
itself O
anymore O
. O

it's O
so O
useable O
and O
responsive O
. O

it O
is O
truly O
a O
desktop O
replacement O
. O

i O
only O
used O
it O
to O
browse O
the O
internet O
and O
and O
i O
dont O
know O
how O
many O
times O
it O
has O
spontaniously O
shut O
down O
and O
it O
is O
just O
a O
blank O
screen O
now O
. O

a O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
is O
well O
, O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

very O
long O
life O
battery B
up O
to O
<number> O
<number> O
hours O
depending O
on O
how O
you O
configure O
power O
level O
settings O
. O

screen O
is O
awesome O
, O
battery B
life B
is O
good O
. O

the O
black O
model O
also O
has O
a O
very O
nice O
seamless O
appearance B
one O
of O
the O
better O
looking O
notebooks O
i've O
seen O
. O

in O
my O
opinion O
it O
was O
not O
as O
user O
friendly O
as O
i O
expected O
either O
. O

the O
technical B
service B
for B
dell B
is O
so O
3rd O
world O
it O
might O
as O
well O
not O
even O
bother O
. O

the O
graphics B
were O
awful O
and O
the O
warranty B
isn't O
even O
worth O
the O
cheap O
payment O
on O
the O
computer O
. O

and O
if O
u O
did O
. O

i've O
had O
the O
macbook O
pro O
<number> O
for O
about O
three O
weeks O
, O
and O
it O
really O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
. O

they O
gave O
me O
a O
hard O
time O
yet O
again O
, O
but O
their O
was O
a O
malfunction O
in O
the O
battery B
itself O
, O
it O
didn't O
die O
. O

it O
was O
definelty O
a O
smart O
move O
. O

i'm O
excited O
to O
learn O
more O
about O
what O
this O
powerful O
machine O
has O
to O
offer O
and O
encourage O
others O
to O
do O
the O
same O
. O

apparently O
they O
are O
defective O
since O
they O
are O
not O
securely O
attached O
. O

but O
other O
then O
that O
i O
would O
give O
this O
product O
a O
<number> O
in O
hafe O
stars O
. O

sure O
hope O
best O
buy O
will O
replace O
it O
asap O
. O

i O
babyed O
the O
heck O
out O
of O
it O
and O
i O
still O
do O
. O

handles O
all O
my O
basic O
media O
needs O
easily O
. O

just O
what O
the O
doctor O
ordered O
. O

if O
you O
don't O
feel O
comfortable O
doing O
it O
yourself O
, O
just O
buy O
the O
case B
and O
be O
happy O
, O
plus O
it O
looks O
nice O
, O
i O
bought O
the O
white O
one O
from O
best O
buy O
. O

the O
reaction O
of O
toshiba O
is O
there O
is O
nothing O
you O
can O
do O
about O
it O
so O
just O
sit O
back O
and O
except O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
are O
powerless O
and O
it O
is O
mind O
over O
matter O
. O

you O
can O
find O
many O
laptops O
with O
the O
same O
performance B
and O
even O
better O
with O
lower O
price B
, O
but O
you O
cannot O
find O
the O
look B
, O
easy O
, O
applications B
, O
and O
the O
experience O
in O
mac O
. O

excellent O
speed B
for O
processing O
data O
. O

all O
in O
all O
, O
i'm O
incredibly O
dissatisfied O
with O
this O
laptop O
, O
and O
with O
hp O
as O
a O
whole O
. O

i O
am O
not O
happy O
at O
all O
with O
the O
product O
i O
purchased O
. O

when O
you O
call O
tech B
support B
you O
were O
routed O
to O
someone O
who O
was O
in O
another O
country O
and O
did O
not O
know O
what O
they O
were O
doing O
. O

it O
has O
come O
into O
good O
use B
for O
my O
finances O
, O
scheduling O
, O
my O
parents O
business O
expenses O
, O
and O
it O
is O
definitely O
amazing O
for O
gaming B
. O

i O
was O
taught O
to O
use O
photoshop O
and O
was O
amazed O
. O

this O
laptop O
, O
had O
a O
compaq O

i O
tried O
out O
another O

it O

other O
intrusive O
things O
from O

after O
the O
first O
few O
months O
, O
the O
computer O
started O
crashing O
about O
every O
week O
. O

my O
son O
and O
his O
family O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
financially O
because O
he O
is O
self O
employed O
so O
the O
family O
had O
no O
computer O
of O
any O
kind O
, O
and O
kyle O
the O
oldest O
child O
is O
<number> O
and O
really O
need O
something O
to O
help O
him O
in O
school O
. O

it's O
a O
great O
product O
for O
a O
great O
price B
! O

again O
, O
the O
same O
problem O
, O
the O
right B
speaker B
did O
not O
work O
. O

but O
see O
the O
macbook O
pro O
is O
different O
because O
it O
may O
have O
a O
huge O
price B
tag B
but O
it O
comes O
with O
the O
full O
software B
that O
you O
would O
actually O
need O
and O
most O
of O
it O
has O
free O
future O
updates B
. O

before O
i O
bought O
my O
new O
i5 O
, O
i O
did O
my O
research O
for O
about O
<number> O
weeks O
and O
determined O
to O
move O
for O
hp O
to O
apple O
for O
reliability O
, O
dependable O
, O
and O
long O
lasting O
operations O
. O

dell O
wanted O
to O
charge O
us O
for O
everything O
everytime O
i O
called O
them O
with O
a O
problem O
. O

this O
has O
been O
nothing O
but O
a O
headache O
since O
we O
purchased O
it O
. O

i O
have O
had O
my O
dell O
latitude O
for O
almost O
three O
years O
. O

may O
be O
better O
for O
the O
occasional O
web O
surfer O

and O
the O
multiple B
page B
viewer B
allows O
you O
to O
press O
one O

to O
see O
every O
separate O

great O
for O
those O
who O
are O
working O
non O

or O
just O
shopping O
online O
. O

this O
was O
the O
3rd O
day O
and O
part O
still O

. O

obviously O
we O
both O
got O
new O
macs O
. O

my O
iphone O
synced O
right O
up O
just O
like O
a O
person O
would O
expect O

unlike O
the O

a O
bookstore O
, O
sit O
in O
the O
coffee O
shop O
area O
, O
sign O
in O

look O
up O

not O
super O
fancy O
, O
but O
not O
super O
expensive O
either O
. O

keyboard O
good O
sized O
and O
wasy O
to O
use B
. O

hp O
said O
it O
was O
out O
of O
warranty B
. O

stay O
away O
from O
apple O
, O
or O
hope O
you O
laptop O
does O
not O
break O
down O
. O

it's O
a O
great O
prodcut O
to O
handle O
basic O
computing O
needs O
. O

i O
never O
had O
this O
kind O
of O
quality B
issue O
with O
dell O
not O
to O
say O
dell O
is O
that O
great O
, O
not O
with O
a O
brand O
new O
laptop O
. O

wonderful O
features B
. O

the O
laptop O
was O
really O
good O
and O
it O
goes O
really O
fast O
just O
the O
way O
i O
thought O
it O
would O
of O
run O
. O

i O
had O
to O
call O
hp O
and O
ask O
for O
a O
recovery B
disk B
because O
the O
computer O
does O
not O
come O
with O
one O
and O
completely O
redo O
it O
all O
. O

im O
glad O
that O
it O
has O
such O
great O
features B
in O
it O
. O

it's O
just O
a O
great O
toy O
to O
have O
around O
. O

i O
like O
those O
programs B
better O
than O
office O
and O
you O
can O
save O
your O
files O
to O
be O
completely O
compatible O
with O
the O
office O
programs B
as O
well O
. O

great O
wifi B
too O
. O

when O
typing O
, O
letters O
and O
spaces O
are O
frequently O
omitted O
requiring O
the O
user O
to O
redo O
many O
words O
and O
sentences O
. O

only O
a O
few O
days O
after O
i O
received O
the O
computer O
back O
, O
the O
screen B
froze O
again O
. O

it O
is O
not O
ideal O
for O
children O
because O
of O
the O
temp B
. O

sounds O
like O
a O
typewriter O
, O
but O
if O
you O
can O
get O
past O
that O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
laptop O
for O
a O
little O
money O
! O

when O
this O
happened O
i O
would O
have O
to O
completely O
power O
off O
my O
computer O
and O
restart O
it O
. O

although O
i O
do O
believe O
that O
windows O
operating B
system B
may O
be O
to O
fault O
for O
some O
of O
the O
problems O
. O

great O
os O
, O
fabulous O
improvements O
to O
the O
existing O
line O
bumping O
up O
the O
processor B
speed B
and O
adding O
the O
thunderbolt B
port B
. O

i O
or O
my O
dad O
paid O
over O
twenty O
four O
hundred O
dollars O
for O
everything O
. O

the O
lcd B
screen B
stopped O
working O
on O
mine O
after O
<number> O
months O
. O

that O
includes O
transferring O
my O
music O
and O
movies O
. O

great O
, O
quick O
laptop O
for O
the O
money O
. O

although O
its O
windows B
vista B
compared O
to O
windows B
xp B
sucks O
. O

we O
have O
had O
numerous O
problems O
with O
vista O
, O
such O
as O
adobe O
flash O
player B
just O
quits O
and O
has O
to O
be O
uninstalled O
and O
then O
reinsalled O
, O
internet O
explore O

probably O
<number> O
times O
, O
the O
same O
update B
. O

the O
dell O
mini O
was O
the O
first O
dell O
product O
that O
i O
had O
ever O
purchased O
. O

with O
the O
switch B
being O
at O
the O
top O
you O
need O
to O
memorize O
the O
key O
combination O
rather O
than O
just O
flicking O
a O
switch B
. O

my O
mac O
has O
gone O
from O
being O
a O
trusted O
friend O
to O
an O
adversary O

a O
4gb O

by O
week O
two O
, O
my O
laptop O
had O
overheated O
and O
was O
completely O
dead O
even O
though O
i O
did O
not O
use O
it O
too O
much O
. O

and O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
get O
them O
back O
in O
. O

my O
last O
laptop O
gave O
me O
a O
constant O
battle O
even O
though O
it O
was O
also O
completely O
new O
. O

i O
have O
been O
a O
mac O
user O
since O
the O
mid O
90s O
. O

it O
has O
bein O
into O
the O
shop O
to O
get O
a O
new O
hardrive B
<number> O
times O
and O
to O
fix O
the O
touch B
control B
buttons B
on O
the O
keyboard B
! O

after O
the O
bad O
experience O
with O
this O
computer O
went O
back O
to O
compaq O
. O

finally O
after O
months O
of O
research O
the O
discovered O
that O
they O
mailed O
it O
to O
a O
walmart O
and O
there O
probably O
would O
be O
no O
way O
to O
find O
the O
box O
. O

it O
doesn't O
heat O
up O
like O
my O
old O
laptop O
. O

i O
always O
have O
used O
a O
tower O
home O
pc O
and O
jumped O
to O
the O
laptop O
and O
have O
been O
very O
satisfied O
with O
its O
performance B
. O

it's O
solid O
. O

before O
i O
got O
my O
macbook O
, O
i O
owned O
a O
dell O
laptop O
. O

this O
laptop O
is O
the O
most O
amazing O
little O
peice O
of O
machinery O
i O
have O
owned O
outside O
of O
the O
iphone O
. O

the O
computer O
runs B
very O
fast O
with O
no O
problems O
and O
the O
ilife O
software B
that O
comes O
with O
it O
iphoto O
, O
imovie O
, O
iweb O
, O
itunes O
, O
garageband O
is O
all O
very O
helpful O
as O
well O
. O

at O
first O
it O
worked O
well O
for O
a O
month O
or O
so O
then O
the O
system B
board B
failed O
and O
i O
send O
it O
in O
to O
toshiba O
some O
complaints O
and O
three O
weeks O
later O
i O
then O
receive O
my O
laptop O
back O
only O
to O
discover O
that O
it O
still O
has O
the O
same O
problem O
so O
now O
i O
have O
to O
send O
it O
back O
again O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
again O
. O

until O
i O
bought O
the O
dell O
, O
i O
thought O
you O
just O
looked O
for O
what O
you O
wanted O
size B
, O
software B
, O
options O
, O
hardware B
and O
purchase O
the O
best O
deal O
you O
could O
find O
. O

i O
don't O
know O
how O
i O
could O
ever O
live O
without O
my O
qousmio O
. O

it O
has O
plenty O
of O
memory B
, O
lots O
of O
hard B
drive B
, O
and O
great O
graphics B
. O

it O
didn't O
take O
me O
long O
to O
get O
switched O
over O
to O
the O
mac O
computer O
programs B
and O
navigation B
it's O
been O
just O
fine O
and O
like O
the O
way O
this O
laptop O
functions O
much O
better O
. O

it O
lasted O
for O
many O
years O
of O
travel O
, O
kids O
and O
abuse O
and O
if O
i O
fired O
it O
up O
today O
, O
it O
would O
work O
. O

been O
a O
pc O
user O
for O
many O
, O
many O
years O
. O

i O
have O
never O
had O
any O
issues O
or O
problems O
with O
my O
macbook O
pro O
so O
far O
, O
and O
it O
is O
still O
as O
fast O
as O
it O
was O
when O
i O
first O
bought O
it O
. O

it O
freezes O
, O
and O
it O
always O
shows O
that O
there O
is O
an O
error O
, O
so O
i O
have O
to O
restart O
it O
a O
few O
times O
every O
time O
i O
use O
it O
. O

however O
, O
my O
girlfriend O
realized O
that O
the O
netbook's O
hinge B
is O
a O
bit O
loose O
when O
you O
open O
or O
close O
the O
lcd O
. O

my O
problem O
was O
with O
dell O
customer O
service O
. O

there O
are O
so O
many O
things O
wrong O
with O

want O
to O
set O
my O
self O
on O
fire O
! O

it O
is O
not O
even O
a O

. O

i O
don't O
do O

on O
it O
, O
just O
write O
papers O
, O
check O
mail O
, O
and O
sometimes O
play O
games O
, O
so O
i O

reccomend O
it O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
computer O
field O
. O

great O
for O
one O
year O

and O
as O
soon O
as O

faster O
than O
any O

i'm O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
machine O
! O

i O
do O
not O
recommend O
this O
company O
or O
their O
products O
! O
! O
! O
! O

i O
like O
this O
machine O
because O
its O
very O
lightweight O
. O
. O
. O

first O
it O
burned O
or O
fused O
the O
power B
adapter B
plug B
. O

the O
features B
are O
great O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
it O
needs O
is O
better O
speakers B
. O

it O
was O
still O
working O
, O
but O
there O
was O
nothing O
on O
the O
screen B
. O

i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
and O
found O
its O
tab O
is O
not O
functioning O
. O

toshiba O
is O
aware O
of O
the O
issue O
but O
unless O
the O
extended B
warrenty B
is O
bought O
toshiba O
will O
do O
nothing O
about O
it O
. O

hp O
said O
i O
had O
done O
the O
damage O
. O

called O

again O
, O
they O
report O
that O
tft O
panel B
is O
broken O
, O
should O
be O
fixed O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
week O
week O

the O
computer O
is O
far O
superior O
compared O
to O

, O
as O
well O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

if O
i O
had O
to O
buy O
another O
computer O
, O
i O
would O
most O
definetly O
buy O
an O
acer O
one O
computer O
. O

the O
screen B
is O
framed O
by O
half O
to O
a O
full O
inch O
margin O
that O
is O
obviously O
unnecessary O
, O
reduces O
the O
screen B
size B
and O
increases O
the O
bulk B
. O

though O
the O
picture B
, O
video B
, O
and O
music B
software B
is O
nowhere O
close O
to O
professional O
grade O
software B
im O
used O
to O
cs5 O
but O
does O
the O
job O
for O
beginner O
and O
even O
intermediate O
media O
designers O
. O

i O
previously O
owned O
an O
hp O
desktop O
and O
a O
dell O
laptop O
. O

everything O
else O
just O
install O
and O
go O

this O
thing O
is O
a O
lemon O
. O

my O
laptop O
is O
almost O
2yrs O
old O
and O
i O
have O
never O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
it O
. O

all O
the O
customers O
that O
come O
in O
hate O
dell O
. O

we O
now O
own O
two O
of O
these O
, O
identical O
. O

i've O
already O
recommended O
this O
laptop O
to O
a O
friend O
who O
eye'd O
the O
computer O
when O
i O
took O
it O
out O
of O
my O
bag O
. O

i O
enjoy O
very O
much O
my O
new O
toshiba O
, O
purchased O
specifially O
for O
attending O
online O
schooling O
. O

once O
you O
go O
mac O
, O
you O
can't O
go O
back O
! O

i O
brought O
this O
laptop O
last O
friday O
, O
and O
originally O
it O
worked O
fantastic O
. O

the O
much O
lauded O
combined B
touch B
pad B
and B
clicker B
is O
a O
nightmare O
. O

the O
unibody O
construction B
is O
solid O
, O
sleek O
and O
beautiful O
. O

they're O
easy O
, O
fun O
, O
powerful O
and O
will O
last O
a O
long O
time O
. O

i O
want O
my O
l505 O
s5988 O
back O
! O

i O
let O
my O
friend O
borrow O
it O
, O
and O
she O
knows O
nothing O
about O
computers O
, O
and O
she O
used O
it O
with O
ease O
. O

this O
macbook O
is O
an O
outstanding O
product O
with O
great O
value B
. O

if O
that O
is O
the O
case O
for O
you O
, O
i O
would O
suggest O
a O
pull O
behind O
solution O
when O
looking O
at O
cases O
. O

i O
had O
to O
re O
install O
windows O
within O
two O
weeks O
of O
the O
purchase O
and O
soon O
discovered O
cracks O
in O
the O
screen B
hinges B
. O

a O
second O
problem O
involves O
the O
battery O
which O
is O
advertised O
as O
having O
a O
storage O
life O
of O
<number> O
hours O
but O
when O
fully O
charged O
shows O
only O
<number> O
hours O
of O
service O
. O

and O
plenty O
of O
storage B
with O
<number> O
gb O
though O
i O
will O
upgrade O
this O
and O
the O
ram B
. O

teaching O

it O
turned O
out O

be O
a O
very O
unstable O
, O
unreliable O
laptop O
for O

. O

i O
bought O
this O

last O
as O
long O
as O
they O
say O
it O
will O
more O
like O
<number> O
hours O

also O
, O
because O
of O
the O
size B
and O
consistancy B
of O
the O
laptop O
computer O
, O
some O
websites O
wouldn't O
even O
attempt O
to O
work O
on O
the O
computer O
because O
of O
browser O
problems O
. O

i O
work O
with O
kids O
and O
they O
love O
making O
short O
videos O
on O
there O
. O

it O
is O
very O
durable O
, O
i O
am O
pretty O
rough O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
electronics O
and O
it O
has O
taken O
it O
all O
with O
no O
reprecutions O
yet O
. O

the O
key B
bindings B
take O
a O
little O
getting O
used O
to O
, O
but O
have O
loved O
the O
macbook O
pro O
. O

keyboard O
is O
reasonable O
size B
. O

instead O
it O
is O
sitting O
in O
west O
verginia O
waiting O
for O
ups O
to O
take O
two O
days O
to O
send O
me O
a O

and O
two O

for O
them O
to O
ship O
the O

some O
<number> O
miles O
by O

to O
louisville O

i'm O
now O
trying O
to O
decide O
on O
another O

i O
find O
myself O
using O
the O
<number> O

more O
than O
i O
thought O
i O
would O
. O

the O
macbook O
is O
a O
fantastic O
laptop O
. O

fan B
noise O
the O
fan B
made O
a O
constant O
hissing O
noise O
in O
the O
background O
. O

i O
believe O
this O
is O
because O
i O
was O
more O
active O
than O
the O
average O
user O
, O
meaning O
i O
average O
about O
three O
tabs O
. O

best O
buy O
rocks O
! O

a O
couple O
things O
you O
should O
know O

bought O
the O
first O
asus O
laptop O
in O
san O
francisco O
, O
returned O
it O
in O
santa O
maria O
, O
thinking O
it O
was O
just O
a O
problem O
with O
that O
computer O
. O

the O
screen B
is O
bright O
and O
clear O
, O
the O
operating B
system B
is O
solid O
and O
friendly O
to O
a O
novice O
. O

it O
has O
a O
. O
<number> O
ghz O
faster O
processor B
and O
a O
stock O
500gb B
hard B
drive B
. O

the O
feature B
are O
good O
enough O
for O
what O
i O
need O
. O

all O
the O
yada O
yada O
. O

finally O
, O
the O
biggest O
problem O
has O
been O
tech B
support B
. O

this O
laptop O
is O
great O
for O
work O
and O
doing O
my O
pictures O
. O

i O
had O
the O
computer O
for O
a O
full O
year O
and O
it O
was O
a O
new O
computer O
. O

this O
isn't O
a O
big O
deal O
, O
i O
haven't O
noticed O
the O
issue O
with O
dvds O
or O
other O
media O
, O
only O
through O
usb O
output B
. O

i O
love O
it O
! O

with O
windows O
laptops O
a O
wireless B
mouse B
is O
an O
absolute O
must O
. O

i O
had O
been O
a O
windows O
linux O
user O
before O
this O
i O
love O
the O
size B
because O
the O
screen B
is O
big O
enough O
for O
what O
i O
use O
it O
for O
internet O
, O
artwork O
, O
and O
yet O
it O
is O
small O
enough O
to O
be O
reasonably O
portable O
. O

but O
if O
you're O
willing O
to O
pay O
another O
<number> O
dollar O
for O
a O
windows B
disc B
. O

very O
good O
quality B
and O
well O
made O
. O

i O
bought O
a O
logitech O
desktop O
set O
in O
anticipation O
for O
using O
with O
the O
mbp O
, O
but O
i O
use O
the O
touchpad B
<number> O
of O
the O
time O
. O

when O
calling O
dell O
for O
help O
, O
reurn O
, O
or O
a O
new O
computer O
they O
were O
not O
useful O
and O
left O
it O
up O
to O
myself O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
to O
do O
with O
it O
. O

two O
of O
the O
times O
was O
in O
one O
month O
. O

so O
needless O
to O
day O
, O
i'm O
not O
happy O
. O

my O
niece O
and O
nephew O
have O
played O
a O
few O
web O
games O
and O
it O
runs O
anything O
that O
doesn't O
require O
a O
dedicated O
video B
card B
. O

although O
i O
was O
promised O
about O
<number> O
hours O
, O
i O
found O
myself O
to O
a O
limited O
<number> O
hours O
which O
is O
still O
amazing O
. O

it O
had O
the O
full O
sized O
touch B
pad B
with O
<number> O
buttons O
instead O
of O
just O
one O
. O

it O
was O
also O
cheaper O
than O
the O
pro O
which O
made O
it O
even O
more O
appealing O
to O
me O
. O

typically O
, O
when O
i O
purchase O
a O
new O
laptop O
i O
always O
end O
up O
using O
an O
external B
mouse B
for O
convenience O
. O

consumer O
report O
recommended O
toshiba O
. O

needless O
to O
say O
i O
told O
them O
no O
and O
have O
a O
nice O
day O
and O
hung O
up O
! O

it O
was O
super O
easy O
to O
set B
up B
and O
is O
really O
easy O
to O
get O
used O
to O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
that O
can O
be O
updated O
is O
the O
video B
, O
other O
than O
that O
you're O
all O
set O
. O

it O
wasn't O
worth O
it O
. O

its O
a O
good O
laptop O
for O
its O
value B
. O

and O
i O
babyed O
the O
heck O
out O
of O
it O
just O
one O
day O
when O
i O
opened O
it O
turned O
it O
on O
went O
to O
click O
and O
it O
was O
broke O
. O

probbly O
the O
worst O
decision O
we O
ever O
made O
! O

then O
the O
hard B
drive B
failed O
; O

this O
computer O
literally O
takes O
about O
five O
minutes O
to O
start O
up O
and O
to O
be O
able O
to O
use O
without O
it O
crawling O
and O
i O
do O
mean O
crawling O
. O

i O
had O
less O
problems O
. O

it O
will O
be O
returned O
in O
the O
state O
to O
which O
it O
was O
shipped O
michigan O
. O

plain O
and O
simple O
, O
it O
laptop O
runs B
great O
and O
loads B
fast O
. O

this O
machine O
rocks O
! O

of O
course O
my O
warranty B
runs O
out O
next O
month O
. O

my O
next O
laptop O
will O
also O
be O
a O
mac O
! O

but O
not O
in O
this O
case O
. O

taking O
notes O
, O
research O
, O
an O
online O
class O
and O
such O
and O
didn't O
want O
to O
spend O
too O
much O
on O
my O
first O
machine O
. O

the O
capabilities O
using O
that O
program B
alone O
made O
me O
want O
a O
mac O
. O

when O
i O
got O
this O
laptop O
in O
<number> O
to O
help O
me O
with O
school O
, O
i O
had O
a O
hard O
time O
from O
beginning O
. O

i O
do O
not O
know O
for O
sure O
. O

no O
machine O
has O
come O
remotely O
close O
to O
causing O
as O
many O
problems O
. O

every O
single O
one O
we've O
gotten O
we've O
had O
problems O
with O
. O

it O
is O
the O
worst O
computer O
dell O
ever O
made O
. O

if O
you O
ever O
see O
the O
spinning B
beachball B
come O
up O
when O
you O
think O
it O
shouldn't O
, O
check O
the O
activity O
monitor O
app O
to O
see O
if O
the O
disk B
throughput B
has O
temporarily O
dropped O
to O
zero O
. O

i O
have O
found O
also O
, O
it O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
be O
able O
to O
access B
wireless B
internet B
access B
; O

about O
<number> O
<number> O
of O
the O
sites O
i O
need O
to O
visit O
because O
of O
my O
work O
contain O
some O
type O
of O
flash O
. O

this O
is O
a O
great O
value B
for O
the O
money O
. O

it O
was O
a O
great O
laptop O
, O
ran B
great O
and O
was O
really O
fast O
. O

the O
battery B
has O
never O
worked O
well O
. O

return O
it O
. O

i O
can O
guarantee O
this O
will O
be O
the O
last O
dell O
i O
will O
ever O
purchase O
! O

they O
said O
it O
was O
a O
computer O
error O
on O
this O
type O
of O
computer O
. O

i O
will O
never O
buy O
another O
computer O
from O
dell O
ever O
again O
do O
to O
how O
awful O
it O
worked O
and O
how O
i O
was O
treated O
by O
the O
company B
. O

my O
review O
mainly O
talks O
about O
the O
difference O
i O
have O
felt O
between O
an O
early O
<number> O
and O
late O
<number> O
mac O
book O
pro O
. O

that O
was O
a O
big O
mistake O
. O

the O
only O
problem O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
screen B
resolutions B
! O

small O
enough O
to O
use O
on O
a O
long O
flight O
, O
light O
enough O
to O
carry B
through O
airports O
and O
powerful O
enough O
to O
replace O
my O
desktop O
while O
on O
long O
business O
trips O
. O

typing O
on O
the O
keyboard B
becomes O
uncomfortable O
after O
extended O
use O
due O
to O
the O
sharp O
edges B
that O
your O
wrists O
rest O
on O
. O

if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
netbook O
pc O
do O
not O
buy O
from O
asus O
! O
! O
! O

it O
has O
many O
great O
programs B
, O
such O
as O
ilife O
, O
iphotos O
and O
others O
. O

other O
thoughts O
received O
replacement O
<number> O
days O
later O
. O

if O
the O
number O
of O
patrons O
in O
the O
apple O
store O
are O
any O
indication O
, O
hp O
and O
other O
pc O
manufacturers O
need O
to O
take O
note O
. O

the O
processor B
went O
on O
me O
, O
the O
fan B
went O
and O
the O
motherboard B
went O
. O

i O
bought O
my O
first O
macbook O
after O
seeing O
the O
product O
demonstrated O
. O

it O
is O
very O
well O
built B
. O

might O
not O
make O
the O
avid O
gamer O
happy O
but O
i O
don't O
really O
think O
that O
is O
what O
this O
computer O
is O
designed O
for O
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
to O
anybody O
that O
wants O
great O
performance B
from O
a O
laptop O
and O
would O
like O
to O
relax O
and O
not O
become O
enraged O
cursing O
the O
gods O
about O
to O
throw O
your O
laptop O
out O
the O
door O
. O

the O
screen B
resolution B
was O
exactly O
what O
i O
was O
looking O
for O
. O

even O
though O
it O
is O
running O
snow O
leopard O
, O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
ghz O
c2d O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
an O
antiquated O
cpu O
and O
thus O
the O
occasional O
spinning B
wheel B
would O
appear O
when O
running O
office O
mac O
applications B
such O
as O
word O
or O
excel O
. O

seriously O
why O
haven't O
they O
just O
replaced O
it O
by O
now O
. O

there O
is O
no O
number O
pad B
to O
the O
right O
of O
the O
keyboard B
which O
is O
a O
bummer O
. O

after O
<number> O
<number> O
min O
the O
screen B
of O
the O
notebook O
switched O
off O
. O

if O
upgrade O
is O
possible O
to O
the O
full O
windows O
<number> O
, O
then O
i O
will O
truly O
be O
a O
very O
happy O
geek O
. O

i O
have O
used O
both O
pcs O
and O
macs O
and O
i O
have O
to O
say O
that O
i O
really O
really O
love O
my O
mac O
book O
pro O
. O

i O
was O
originally O
concerned O
that O
i O
couldn't O
view O
work O
i O
had O
done O
in O
college O
on O
my O
mac O
because O
of O
the O
pc O
formatting O
, O
but O
i O
was O
even O
more O
thrilled O
to O
learn O
of O
programs B
like O
ilife O
and O
iwork O
that O
allow O
you O
to O
convert O
your O
pc O
documents O
into O
readable O
files O
on O
macs O
. O

it O
is O
a O
big O
big O
, O
but O
since O
it O
has O
a O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
screen B
what O
would O
you O
expect O
! O

i O
have O
never O
had O
an O
experience O
like O
this O
. O

we O
haven't O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
it O
at O
all O
. O

returned O
it O
to O
walmart O
. O

<number> O
hours O
of O
battery B
life B
is O
really O
something O
else O
. O
. O
. O
. O

i O
love O
everything O
about O
it O
. O

it's O
slow O
and O
one O
day O
i O
hope O
to O
have O
the O
money O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
it O
and O
buy O
something O
else O
. O

it O
meets O
all O
my O
needs O
for O
work O
and O
pleasure O
while O
traveling O
. O

runs O
fast O
and O
the O
regular B
layout B
keyboard B
is O
so O
much O
better O
. O

all O
was O
well O
. O

all O
the O
programs B
are O
easy O
and O
straight O
forward O
on O
my O
macbook O
pro O
, O
it O
is O
clean O
and O
organized O
, O
which O
i O
always O
strive O
to O
be O
myself O
. O

he O
said O
quite O
a O
number O
of O
people O
had O
encountered O
this O
problem O
and O
said O
it O
is O
a O
common O
issue O
. O

not O
worth O
it O
one O
bit O
. O

i O
just O
can't O
fathom O
that O
the O
celebrated O
dell O
would O
last O
a O
week O
in O
environment O
of O
free O
competition O
with O
normal O
products O
it O
only O
survives O
b O
c O
its O
substandard O
laptops O
are O
forced O
onto O
captive O
students O
and O
employees O
through O
question O
raising O
programs O
. O

much O
of O
which O
hp O
ended O
up O
paying O
for O
. O

i O
reinstalled O
windows B
through O
the O
recovery B
discs B
and O
everything O
seemed O
good O
again O
. O

windows O
<number> O
starter O
is O
terrific O
no O
you O
can't O
change O
the O
background O
but O
i O
don't O
need O
to O
, O
i O
use O
it O
just O
for O
school O
work O
. O

support O
has O
been O
lackluster O
and O
now O
i O
just O
want O
a O
refund O
. O

first O
of O
all O
, O
they O
had O
no O
record O
of O
me O
having O
the O
<number> O
year B
warranty B
i'd O
paid O
almost O
<number> O
for O
, O
and O
i O
had O
to O
call O
in O
, O
spend O
hours O
on O
their O
online B
chat B
service B
, O
and O
fax O
in O
multiple O
documents O
. O

i O
hate O
to O
say O
this O
, O
but O
if O
i O
could O
take O
this O
back O
to O
the O
shop O
and O
get O
my O
money O
back O
, O
then O
i O
would O
. O

it O
makes O
doing O
schoolwork O
at O
night O
so O
much O
easier O
. O

being O
only O
<number> O
months O
old O
, O
i O
am O
not O
a O
happy O
camper O
! O

iphoto O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
program O
i O
have O
ever O
worked O
with O
easy O
and O
convenient O
. O

i O
love O
to O
write O
and O
play O
with O

and O
my O
new O
toshiba O
works B
great O
on O
both O
! O

this O
computer O
may O
be O
small O
but O
it O
is O
one O
heck O
of O
a O
power O
horse O
. O

they O
would O
repair O
one O
thing O
, O
send O
it O
back O
and O
it O
would O
still O
have O
the O
same O
problem O
. O

such O
as O
pages O
, O
numbers O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

my O
laptop O
now O
has O
no O
battery B
. O

beta O
had O
better O
quality B
, O
but O
vhs O
became O
the O
industry O
standard O
. O

it O
made O
the O
computer O
much O
easier O
to O
use B
and O
navigate B
. O

if O
you O
buy O
this O
don't O
go O
into O
it O
expecting O
<number> O
hrs O
of O
battery B
life B
, O
and O
you'll O
be O
perfectly O
satisfied O
. O

needs O
longer O
lasting O
battery B
, O
more O
than O
<number> O
to O
<number> O
hrs O
. O

in O
may O
i O
started O
having O
problems O
with O
the O
usb O
ports B
not O
working O
. O

<number> O
plus O
hours O
of O
battery B
. O
. O
. O

if O
only O
bill O
gates O
would O
read O
some O
of O
what O
is O
said O
here O
ms O
would O
do O
a O
better O
job O
. O

the O
design B
is O
awesome O
, O
quality B
is O
unprecedented O
. O

i'm O
going O
to O
try O
and O
keep O
my O
old O
g4 O
on O
the O
road O
for O
as O
long O
as O
possible O
. O

the O
mac O
version B
of B
microsoft O
office O
is O
cheaper O
than O
buying O
the O
actual O
and O
works O
just O
as O
well O
. O

the O
mac O
takes O
about O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
starting O
up O
time B
as O
the O
average O
pc O
, O
but O
keeps O
itself O
cleaned O
up O
and O
ready O
to O
use O
. O

its O
hard O
to O
encounter O
a O
problem O
on O
a O
mac O
that O
would O
require O
such O
abrupt O
action O
. O

the O
toshiba O
net O
book O
operates B
very O
well O
. O

i O
loved O
it O
. O

the O
touch B
pad B
is O
fine O
again O
, O
it's O
a O
real O
touch B
pad B
. O

the O
pictures B
are O
clear O
as O
can O
be O
. O

it O
is O
also O
very O
lightweight O
, O
making O
transporting B
this O
computer O
very O
easy O
. O

if O
anything O
, O
i O
would O
only O
suggest O
using O
one O
of O
these O
laptops O
if O
only O
you O
have O
to O
. O

i O
sit O
down O
and O
use O
my O
husband's O
work O
pc O
and O
i O
don't O
like O
it O
one O
bit O
. O

it's O
wonderful O
for O
computer O
gaming B
. O

you O
have O
to O
toss O
out O
the O
wifi B
card B
and O
replace O
it O
just O
to O
have O
any O
sort O
of O
network B
capability B
. O

and O
the O
best O
part O
is O
that O
it O
even O
comes O
with O
a O
free O
printer B
when O
they O
have O
a O
certain O
promotion O
offer O
going O
, O
of O
course O
! O

the O
place O
we O
bought O
it O
from O
said O
that O
after O
they O
send O
it O
out O
to O
gateway O
<number> O
times O
they O
would O
give O
us O
a O
new O
one O
. O

it O
is O
very O
easy O
for O
anyone O
to O
use B
an O
apple O
and O
specially O
the O
mcbook O
pro O
notebook O
. O

i O
like O
it O
better O
than O
my O
big O
dell O
laptop O
. O

the O
flaws O
are O
, O
this O
computer O
is O
not O
for O
computer O
gamers O
because O
of O
the O
os O
x O
. O

i O
tried O
giving O
it O
<number> O
stars O
but O
i O
had O
to O
choose O
at O
least O
one O
, O
but O
imo O
no O
stars O

they O
really O
do O
have O
the O
worlds O
very O
worst O
repair B
service B
. O

they O
need O
to O
stop O
outsoucing O
and O
send O
some O
complaint O
calls O
to O
us O
based O
customer B
service B
agents B
for O
those O
who O
live O
in O
the O
united O
states O
. O

i O
was O
also O
able O
to O
install O
and O
use O
my O
photoshop O
and O
aftereffects O
programs B
easily O
. O

it's O
perfect O
for O
everything O
and O
runs B
faster O
than O
an O
average O
pc O
! O

for O
being O
so O
small O
it O
is O
amazing O
that O
it O
is O
as O
fast O
as O
it O
is O
. O

heck O
, O
i O
like O
all O
mac O
computers O
, O
but O
they're O
all O
way O
too O
pricey O
for O
the O
kind O
of O
economy O
the O
u O
. O
s O
. O
is O
going O
through O
. O

then O
after O
paying O
for O
it O
to O
be O
examined O
i O
was O
told O
it O
was O
same O
problem O
cited O
on O
website O
but O
i'd O
have O
to O
pay O
anyways O
since O
it O
was O
past O
warrenty B
. O

they O
claim O
that O
i O
should O
be O
happy O
because O
i O
am O
getting O
a O
new O
laptop O
to O
replace O
my O
two O
month O
old O
laptop O
. O

i'm O
already O
hooked O
on O
the O
sleek O
look B
and O
dependability B
that O
this O
laptop O
has O
shown O
. O

the O
machine O
itself O
is O
alright O
. O

it O
seems O
to O
have O
some O
opions O
that O
are O
intalled O
but O
do O
not O
work O
like O
i O
thought O
they O
would O
. O

and O
having O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
company B
has O
been O
a O
even O
worse O
nightmare O
. O

i O
will O
definitely O
be O
getting O
a O
new O
laptop O
if O
it O
has O
any O
more O
issues O
after O
the O
warranty B
expires O
and O
researching O
carefully O
when O
i O
do O
so O
i O
don't O
run O
accross O
a O
situation O
like O
this O
again O
! O

i O
also O
experience O
the O
same O
with O
my O
macbook O
air O
. O

it O
has O
all O
the O
features B
that O
are O
necessary O
for O
college O
and O
if O
not O
they O
are O
able O
to O
be O
added O
onto O
the O
computer O
. O

i O
have O
owned O
many O
different O
brands O
of O
laptops O
in O
my O
life O
. O

i O
did O
an O
internet O
search O
and O
this O
is O
a O
very O
common O
problem O
with O
this O
laptop O
. O

i've O
owned O
this O
labtop O
for O
less O
then O
two O
months O
, O
already O
the O
mouse B
button B
has O
broke O
. O

it O
did O
fairly O
well O
, O
other O
than O
it's O
poor O
performance B
, O
overheating O
and O
occational O
blue O
screen O
. O

the O
touchpad B
is O
very O
intuitive O
, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
i O
never O
want O
to O
use O
buttons B
to O
click O
again O
! O

tons O
of O
bloatware O
and O
junk O
programs B
. O

its O
sad O
because O
their O
commercials O
are O
great O
. O

lots O
of O
extra O
space B
but O
the O
keyboard B
is O
ridiculously O
small O
. O

luckily O
, O
dell O
said O
they O
would O
replace O
my O
laptop O
with O
a O
new O
one O
, O
but O
instead O
i O
got O
a O
refund O
and O
bought O
a O
mac O
. O

i O
decided O
to O
get O
this O
pile O
of O
crap O
on O
a O
whim O
and O
totally O
freaking O
regret O
it O
. O

never O
been O
hacked O
. O

it's O
so O
bad O
that O
i'm O
thinking O
i O
only O
got O
half O
a O
battery B
or O
something O
. O

good O
keyboard B
, O
long O
battery B
life B
, O
largest O
hard B
drive B
and O
windows B
<number> O
. O

i O
think O
it O
was O
seventy O
nine O
plus O
tax O
. O

in O
summary O
, O
take O
your O
money O
elsewhere O
. O

the O
processor B
is O
very O
quick O
and O
effective O
as O
i O
load B
webpages B
and O
applications B
. O

my O
battery B
went O
bad O
about O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
after O
having O
it O
and O
it O
cost O
around O
eighty O
to O
a O
hundred O
dollars O
! O

i O
will O
never O
buy O
refurbished O
again O
, O
i O
don't O
cae O
how O
cheap O
it O
is O
. O

it O
pretty O
much O
does O
everything O
we O
could O
ever O
need O
, O
and O
looks O
great O
to O
boot B
. O

it O
is O
just O
slow O
slow O
slow O
. O

bottom O
line O
, O
i O
doubt O
you'd O
be O
overly O
disappointed O
if O
you O
invest O
in O
this O
machine O
. O

as O
a O
lifelong O
windows O
user O
, O
i O
was O
extremely O
pleased O
to O
make O
the O
change O
to O
mac O
. O

so O
, O
owing O
to O
these O
problems O
, O
i O
went O
out O
and O
got O
myself O
an O
apple O
macbook O
pro O
, O
which O
i O
am O
using O
with O
great O
satisfaction O
at O
this O
very O
moment O
. O

the O
macbook O
pro O
is O
extremely O
thin O
and O
light O
compared O
to O
those O
heavy O
windows O
laptop O
. O

so O
this O
was O
great O
for O
me O
. O

this O
is O
the O
first O
macbook O
i O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

the O
acer O
one O
compuer O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
. O

another O
problem O
. O

the O
macbook O
is O
also O
made O
better O
, O
my O
computer O
has O
never O
got O
a O
virus O
, O
and O
the O
laptop O
runs B
just O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
first O
day O
i O
bought O
it O
. O

so O
, O
if O
you're O
thinking O
of O
a O
laptop O
, O
i O
would O
heartily O
recommend O
theapple O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
macbook O
pro O
notebook O
computer O
z0j80001 O
notebook O
for O
all O
your O
needs O
! O

i O
wiped O
nearly O
everything O
off O
of O
it O
, O
installed O
openoffice O
and O
firefox O
, O
and O
i O
am O
operating O
an O
incredibly O
efficient O
and O
useful O
machine O
for O
a O
great O
price B
. O

overall O
i O
feel O
this O
netbook O
was O
poor O
quality B
, O
had O
poor O
performance B
, O
although O
it O
did O
have O
great O
battery B
life B
when O
it O
did O
work O
. O

i O
picked O
it O
out O
because O
it O
was O
inexpensive O
<number> O
and O
i O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
good O
, O
easy O
to O
use B
first O
laptop O
. O

my O
only O
problem O
is O
i O
can O
not O
reg O
. O
the O
product O
key O
. O

the O
time O
remaining O
goes O
from O
<number> O
hours O
plus O
to O
less O
than O
<number> O
hours O
over O
the O
span O
of O
about O
<number> O
minutes O
. O

pay O
attention O
to O
the O
specs B
if O
you O
want O
these O
options O
. O

stupidly O
, O
mind O
numbingly O
slow O
then O
i O
found O
it O
can O
only O
be O
loaded O
with O
2gb O
maximum O
. O

it O
also O
does O
not O
have O
bluetooth B
. O

sure O
it O
has O
the O
one B
touch B
keys B
but O
that O
was O
the O
best O
feature B
of O
the O
computer O
. O

i O
can O
do O
pretty O
much O
<number> O
of O
what O
i O
do O
on O
my O
desktop O
on O
my O
kitchen O
table O
. O

being O
a O
pc O
user O
my O
whole O
life O
. O
. O
. O
. O

great O
battery B
life B
. O

the O
real O
stand O
out O
on O
this O
computer O
is O
the O
feel O
of O
the O
keyboard B
and O
it's O
speed B
. O

at O
first O
, O
the O
computer O
seemed O
a O
great O
deal O
seemingly O
high O
end O
specs B
for O
a O
low O
, O
low O
price B
. O

delivery O
was O
early O
too O
. O

during O
that O
time O
, O
i O
had O
to O
send O
it O
back O
<number> O
times O
. O

although O
i O
opted O
for O
the O
lowest O
end O
macbook O
pro O
, O
this O
thing O
holds O
its O
own O
. O

love O
the O
stability B
of O
the O
mac O
software B
and O
operating B
system B
. O

and O
that O
probably O
explains O
why O
i've O
already O
had O
my O
sata O
controller B
go O
bad O
within O
a O
year O
of O
buying O
it O
. O

i O
left O
the O
place O
angrily O
. O

i O
my O
wife O
is O
also O
now O
the O
proud O
owner O
of O
a O
macbook O
as O
well O
! O

i've O
had O
a O
toshiba O
laptop O
in O
the O
past O
; O

it's O
also O
very O
capable O
of O
doing O
moderate O
video B
editing B
although O
you O
may O
need O
the O
performance B
boost O
of O
the O
larger O
macbook O
pros O
for O
heavy O
duty O
mobile B
video B
editing B
. O

asus O
said O
my O
net O
book O
was O
working O
properly O
. O

i O
received O
this O
laptop O
as O
a O
gift O
and O
let O
me O
just O
tell O
you O
that O
its O
the O
worst O
. O

very O
annoying O
. O

my O
main O
reason O
to O
convert O
was O
the O
imovie B
program B
. O

it O
has O
a O
faster O
processor B
and O
more O
ram B
. O

if O
you O
need O
an O
affordable O
, O
entry O
level O
laptop O
, O
this O
will O
fit O
the O
bill O
. O

laptops O
are O
usually O
used O
on O
the O
go O
, O
so O
why O
not O
give O
you O
a O
better O
battery B
? O

i O
will O
never O
complain O
about O
the O
price B
since O
i O
believe O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
and O
my O
macbook O
pro O
was O
worth O
every O
dollar O
. O

i O
wasn't O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
the O
netbooks O
but O
this O
one O
was O
very O
well O
designed B
. O

it O
may O
take O
a O
little O
getting O
used O
to O
but O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
viruses O
or O
other O
headaches O
. O

and O
the O
warranty B
on O
this O
macbook O
pro O
can O
last O
up O
to O
<number> O
years O
or O
<number> O
battery O
recharge O
cycles O
. O

i O
still O
have O
that O
stupid O
bluetooth B
mouse B
to O
! O

would O
like O
more O
trendy O
, O
high O
tech O
features B
. O

keyboard O
is O
great O
but O
primary O
and O
secondary O
control B
buttons B
could O
be O
more O
durable O
. O

screen O
is O
a O
bit O
glossy O
, O
but O
that's O
not O
too O
bad O
. O

received O
the O
product O
promptly O
and O
without O
any O
issues O
. O

it O
is O
so O
great O
, O
i O
can O
hardly O
ever O
take O
my O
hands O
off O
it O
! O

i O
remind O
myself O
from O
time O
to O
time O
to O
take O
off O
my O
watch O
when O
ever O
i O
look O
at O
the O
small O
scratch O
that O
it O
has O
caused O
. O

i O
got O
it O
back O
again O
and O
was O
told O
the O
motherboard B
had O
been O
replaced O
, O
so O
i O
was O
now O
on O
the O
second O
motherboard B
within O
<number> O
months O
. O

but O
reasons O
we O
chose O
this O
apple O
computer O
. O

processor O
when O
compared O
to O
my O
<number> O
week O
old O
early O
<number> O
edition O
there O
i O
barely O
experience O
any O
difference O
in O
performance B
<number> O
. O
<number> O
ghz O
v O
s O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
ghz O
. O

they O
say O
it O
could O
be O
the O
motherboard B
again O
, O
but O
dell O

i O
upgraded O
from O
a O
<number> O
year O
old O
laptop O
and O
was O
amazed O
to O
find O
out O
that O
this O
computer O
is O
much O
slower O
then O
my O
old O
laptop O
. O

2nd O
best O
computer O
in O
the O
world O
only O
one O
way O
this O
computer O
might O
become O
the O
best O
is O
that O
it O
needs O
to O
upgreade O
patches B
to O
make O
less O
easier O
for O
people O
to O
hack O
into O

love O
the O
speed B
, O
especially O
! O

it O
could O
be O
a O
perfect O
laptop O
if O
it O
would O
have O
faster O
system B
memory B
and O
its O
radeon B
<number> O
would O
have O
ddr5 O
instead O
of O
ddr3 O
. O

not O
only O
are O
the O
versions O
of O
these O
programs B
able O
to O
be O
saved O
, O
worked O
on O
and O
opened O
on O
both O
a O
pc O
and O
mac O
, O
the O
versions O
of O
these O
programs B
on O
a O
mac O
are O
graphically O
and O
functionally O
superior O
. O

by O
air O
sounds O
more O
like O
by O
truck O
to O
me O
. O

so O
far O
it O
has O
been O
five O
months O
since O
the O
last O
problem O
was O
fixed O
and O
i O
am O
praying O
it O
has O
finally O
stopped O
. O

it's O
outstanding O
too O
. O

the O
speed B
gives O
you O
the O
power O
to O
work O
on O
these O
projects O
seamlessly O
, O
and O
multiple O
at O
a O
time O
if O
you O
sowish O
. O

awesome O
laptop O
and O
the O
perfect O
size B
to O
carry O
around O
in O
college O
. O

so O
i'm O
disappointed O
in O
that O
because O
communicating O
with O
my O
relatives O
out O
of O
the O
area O
is O
a O
priority O
. O

a O
month O
later O
, O
we O
reinstall O
the O
os O
vista O
. O

some O
problems O
can O
be O
fixed O
if O
you O
purchase O
new O
software B
, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
guarentee O
. O

my O
real O
problem O
with O
it O
? O
the O
statement O
of O
<number> O
hour O
battery B
life B
is O
not O
just O
mere O
exaggeration O
it's O
a O
lie O
. O

just O
chill O
and O
enjoy O
. O

the O
battery B
life B
is O
also O
relatively O
good O
. O

it O
is O
her O
first O
laptop O
and O
she O
is O
thrilled O
. O

i O
should O
have O
sent O
it O
back O
to O
them O
then O
. O

i O
definitely O
suggest O
getting O
an O
extended B
warranty B
, O
you O
will O
probably O
need O
it O
! O

if O
this O
would O
be O
your O
first O
mac O
purchase O
then O
i O
would O
highly O
suggest O
that O
you O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
class O
that O
they O
offer O
to O
learn O
about O
the O
differences O
between O
mac O
and O
pc's O
. O

this O
laptop O
leaves O
alot O
to O
be O
desired O
, O
i O
have O
had O
it O
only O
<number> O
months O
and O
have O
had O
to O
send O
it O
away O
to O
be O
repaired O
twice O
. O
. O
. O

i O
have O
found O
it O
very O
easy O
to O
use B
, O
very O
imformative O
, O
wonder O
alerts O
and O
tutorials O
making O
it O
very O
easy O
for O
someone O
like O
me O
who O
is O
not O
exactly O
technologically O
advanced O
to O
learn O
to O
use B
the O
various O
features B
and O
programs B
. O

i O
don't O
have O
stupid O
pop B
up B
windows B
even O
when O
i O
have O
pop B
ups B
blocked O
, O
i O
don't O
have O
to O
wait O
<number> O
minutes O
for O
a O
webpage O
to O
download O
, O
and O
best O
of O
all O
i O
can O
run O
all O
the O
web B
programming B
software B
i O
need O
to O
use O
all O
at O
once O
without O
slowing O
me O
down O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
so O
that O
the O
entire O
family O
had O
a O
computer O
in O
the O
living O
room O
; O

don't O
waste O
your O
money O
or O
time O
. O

it O
has O
spent O
more O
time O
in O
repair O
shops O
than O
i O
can O
possibly O
recount O
here O
. O

memory O
is O
upgradable O
. O

web O
access B
through O
the O
3g O
network B
is O
so O
slow O
, O
it's O
very O
frustrating O
and O
very O
disappointing O
. O

well O
, O
i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
a O
month O
or O
two O
ago O
. O

my O
macbook O
pro O
has O
been O
a O
huge O
disappointment O
. O

received O
all O
four O
in O
good O
order O
; O

the O
computer O
first O
started O
malfunctioning O
<number> O
months O
after O
purchasing O
it O
. O

this O
is O
starting O
off O
good O
. O

the O
large O
screen B
also O
helps O
when O
you O
are O
working O
in O
design B
based B
programs B
like O
adobe O
creative O
suite O
. O

the O
only O
pro O
to O
this O
computer O
is O
it O
was O
under O
<number> O
! O

moral O
of O
the O
story O
do O
not O
buy O
anything O
from O
companies B
that O
do O
not O
respect O
their O
customers O
. O

this O
is O
my O
first O
dell O
i O
heard O
their O
customer B
service B
was O
lacking O
and O
that O
they O
were O
working O
on O
improving O
it O
! O

as O
well O
as O
having O
the O
plug B
in O
the O
computer O
come O
loose O
. O

very O
small O
and O
portable O
i've O
had O
this O
netbook O
about O
<number> O
hrs O
now O
and O
it's O
better O
than O
expected O
. O

she O
said O
wal O
mart O
rants O
and O
raves O
abouy O
carring O
dell O
because O
it's O
a O
big O
name O
but O
they O
are O
a O
piece O
of O
garbage O
. O

not O
with O
apple O
. O

after O
<number> O
pleasant O
weeks O
of O
use O
, O
the O
laptop O
just O
died O
. O

each O
time O
taking O
about O
<number> O
day O
or O
so O
. O

second O
hdd O
cover B
has O
walls O
inside O
that O
need O
to O
be O
broken O
if O
you O
what O
to O
install O
one O
. O

if O
you O
want O
more O
information O
on O
macs O
i O
suggest O
going O
to O
apple O
. O
com O
and O
heading O
towards O
the O
macbook O
page O
for O
more O
information O
on O
the O
applications B
. O

so O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
later O
, O
i O
was O
a O
dumb O
college O
girl O
and O
had O
to O
have O
the O
wireless O
internet O
. O

this O
netbook O
went O
bad O
on O
me O
after O
<number> O
days O
. O

probably O
won't O
work O
either O
. O

great O
product O
by O
apple O
with O
the O
new O
great O
looking O
design B
. O

i O
love O
the O
keyboard B
. O

probably O
as O
good O
as O
you O
can O
get O
in O
a O
netbook O
, O
does O
everything O
i O
ask O
for O
and O
has O
some O
very O
good O
unexpected O
pluses O
. O

overall O
i O
am O
very O
satisfied O
with O
the O
purchase O
. O

in O
my O
line O
of O
work O
, O
i O
often O
have O
to O
take O
work O
home O
, O
and O
this O
makes O
it O
so O
easy O
. O

they O
told O
me O
to O
reprogram O
the O
computer O
, O
and O
i O
didn't O
need O
to O
do O
that O
, O
and O
i O
lost O
pictures O
of O
my O
oldests O
first O
<number> O
years O
of O
her O
life O
. O

i O
use O
iphoto B
all O
the O
time O
, O
which O
is O
a O
great O
program B
for O
anyone O
who O
is O
into O
photography O
amateurs O
and O
experts O
alike O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
for O
my O
son O
in O
<number> O
for O
his O
christmas O
present O
. O

it O
took O
so O
much O
time O
. O

i O
hate O
it O
. O

the O
screen B
isn't O
huge O
, O
but O
that O
doesn't O
matter O
when O
i O
output O
media O
to O
the O
<number> O
inch O
lcd O
tv O
. O

i'll O
stick O
to O
tashiba O
. O

i O
will O
have O
to O
purchase O
spy O
ware B
or O
nortell O
for O
privacy O
protection O
. O

you O
will O
not O
regret O
buying O
such O
a O
great O
thing O
like O
this O
! O

i O
was O
said O
it's O
videocard B
. O

plus O
stylish O
. O

for O
the O
price B
and O
what O
i O
get O
out O
of O
it O
has O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O

and O
, O
if O
you O
are O
going O
to O
deal O
with O
hp O
be O
careful O
. O

i O
took O
the O
computer O
into O
best O
buy O
where O
i O
purchased O
it O
and O
they O
kept O
it O
over O
night O
to O
study O
it O
. O

if O
your O
time O
is O
worth O
anything O
to O
you O
, O
if O
you O
are O
tired O
of O
rebooting O
, O
reformatting O
, O
reinstalling O
, O
trying O
to O
find O
drivers B
, O
if O
you O
want O
a O
computer O
to O
work O
for O
you O
for O
a O
change O
, O
make O
the O
change O
to O
this O
computer O
. O

my O
macbook O
pro O
is O
no O
exception O
. O

unless O
you O
don't O
care O
how O
long O
it O
takes O
to O
get O
going O
, O
find O
something O
else O
. O

you O
may O
be O
reading O
one O
now O
! O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
wish O
is O
the O
<number> O
inch O
macbook O
pro O
has O
much O
better O
speakers B
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
keyboard B
. O

i O
will O
have O
to O
say O
that O
i O
love O
my O
macbook O
pro O
! O

in O
fact O
, O
he O
said O
, O
about O
<number> O
of O
their O
products O
fail O
. O

this O
is O
the O
first O
apple O
product O
that O
i O
have O
purchased O
. O

now O
, O
as O
easy O
as O
it O
is O
to O
use B
, O
and O
i O
do O
think O
it O
is O
a O
great O
starter O
laptop O
. O

this O
causes O
my O
wrist O
to O
scrape O
up O
against O
it O
. O

enough O
said O
. O

setting O
would O
change O
for O
some O
reason O
, O
the O
screen B
size B
would O
change O
on O
it's O
own O
, O
like O
the O
pixel B
sizes B
and O
whatnot O
. O

it O
had O
some O
kind O
of O
pre B
installed B
software B
update B
that O
completely O
shut O
the O
computer O
down O
when O
you O
clicked O
it O
. O

ever O
since O
i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
, O
so O
far O
i've O
experience O
nothing O
but O
constant O
break O
downs O
of O
the O
laptop O
and O
bad O
customer B
services B
i O
received O
over O
the O
phone O
with O
toshiba B
customer B
services B
hotlines O
. O

i O
do O
not O
plan O
on O
going O
back O
. O

no O
laptop O
is O
perfect O
, O
but O
sometimes O
you O
just O
find O
a O
computer O
that O
works O
for O
you O
. O

i O
really O
like O
the O
mac O
<number> O
. O
4in O
. O
notebook O
, O
but O
its O
very O
pricey O
. O

also O
, O
the O
space B
bar B
makes O
a O
noisy O
click O
every O
time O
you O
use O
it O
. O

iphotos O
is O
an O
excellent O
program B
for O
storing O
and O
organizing O
photos O
. O

other O
than O
that O
its O
a O
great O
performing B
machine O
and O
well O
meets O
all O
my O
needs O
and O
more O
. O

we O
were O
occasional O
mac O
users O
before O
, O
but O
most O
recently O
owned O
a O
budget O
pc O
since O
it O
is O
what O
we O
could O
afford O
. O

called O
tech O
support O
and O
got O
the O
usual O
acer O
we O
don't O
support O
software B
but O
for O
we O
can O
help O
you O
i O
explained O
there O
was O
no O
software B
involved O
in O
booting B
. O

i O
would O
never O
tell O
anyone O
to O
buy O
one O
either O
. O

the O
programs B
are O
great O
, O
like O
iphoto B
love O
the O
editing O
capabilities O
, O
imail B
which O
can O
incorporate O
with O
the O
address O
book O
on O
the O
ipod O
and O
ipad O
, O
imovie B
, O
etc O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
didn't O
learn O
in O
my O
research O
was O
the O
software B
i O
would O
need O
like O
privacy O
protection O
and O
warranty O
protection O
, O
in O
case O
it O
gets O
broken O
, O
or O
crashes O
etc O
. O

i O
can't O
say O
enough O
good O
for O
it O
! O

comfterbale O
to O
use B
light O
easy O
to O
transport B
. O

the O
computer O
itself O
is O
a O
good O
product O
but O
the O
repair B
depot B
stinks O
. O

i O
thought O
the O
price B
was O
great O
for O
the O
specs B
. O

i O
was O
tired O
of O
going O
without O
my O
laptop O
every O
few O
weeks O
. O

the O
only O
down O
fall O
is O
that O
it O
has O
no O
cd B
drive B
but O
i O
found O
that O
they O
are O
very O
cheap O
to O
by O
and O
also O
very O
portable O
making O
this O
the O
best O
friend O
to O
someone O
who O
is O
always O
looking O
for O
more O
space O
then O
they O
have O
. O

so O
, O
the O
hard B
disk B
capacity B
really O
doesn't O
matter O
to O
me O
. O

just O
for O
a O
stupid O
cd O
. O

keys O
stick O
periodically O
and O
i O
havent O
had O
the O
laptop O
for O
<number> O
days O
yet O
. O

it O
crashes O
, O
and O
when O
it O
goes O
flat O
, O
it O
just O
dies O
like O
a O
pc O
, O
maybe O
worse O
and O
i O
loose O
all O
my O
open O
documents O
! O

i O
also O
like O
that O
you O
can O
scroll O
down O
in O
a O
window O
using O
two O
fingers O
on O
the O
trackpad B
. O

everything O
from O
the O
design B
to O
the O
os O
is O
simple O
and O
to O
the O
point O
. O

i O
am O
now O
making O
a O
point O
to O
avoid O
their O
products O
and O
i O
hope O
my O
experience O
can O
serve O
as O
a O
warning O
to O
you O
as O
well O
. O

i'v O
spent O
as O
much O
for O
shipping B
as O
i O
would O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
netbook O
of O
course O
a O
different O
brand O
. O

i O
personally O
like O
the O
gaming B
look B
but O
needed O
a O
machine O
that O
delivered O
gaming B
performance B
while O
still O
looking O
professional O
in O
front O
of O
my O
customers O
. O

this O
just O
keeps O
having O
it's O
hard B
drive B
replaced O
! O

when O
you O
look O
at O
the O
specs O
on O
apple O
products O
in O
comparison O
to O
a O
dell O
or O
a O
hp O
, O
yes O
they O
do O
seem O
to O
offer O
less O
for O
a O
higher O
cost B
. O

then O
i O
proceed O
to O
tell O
her O
that O
i O
checked O
out O
other O
retail O
stores O
that O
carry O
the O
netbook O
and O
it O
wasn't O
like O
that O
. O

then O
they O
had O
me O
jump O
through O
many O
hoops O
and O
questions O
to O
see O
if O
they O
could O
find O
another O
way O
to O
invalidate O
me O
. O

the O
only O
downfall O
is O
the O
volume B
control B
. O

clearly O
, O
there O
is O
something O
wrong O
with O
the O
product O
and O
lg O
didn't O
take O
up O
the O
responsibility O
. O

very O
fast O
boot B
up B
and O
shut B
down B
. O

right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
, O
this O
little O
netbook O
did O
everything O
i O
asked O
of O
it O
, O
including O
streaming O
the O
everyday O
video O
you're O
bound O
to O
encounter O
checking O
mail O
and O
websites O
my O
biggest O
complaint O
previously O
. O

i O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
laptop O
. O

this O
laptop O
is O
durable O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
travel O
with O
. O

i O
finally O
decided O
on O
this O
laptop O
because O
it O
was O
the O
right O
price B
for O
what O
i O
need O
it O
. O

what O
a O
mistake O
! O

if O
internet B
connectivity B
is O
important O
i O
would O
recommend O
going O
with O
a O
dell O
net O
book O
for O
<number> O
bucks O
more O
, O
or O
buy O
a O
usb O
wireless B
card B
. O

i O
had O
read O
online O
that O
some O
users O
were O
having O
sound B
problems O
. O

my O
last O
computer O
, O
a O
toshiba O
, O
cost B
only O
<number> O
, O
and O
worked O
like O
a O
charm O
for O
many O
years O
. O

it O
discharges B
too O
quickly O
. O

but O
to O
be O
honest O
, O
the O
compatibility B
issues O
and O
the O
other O
little O
quirks O
make O
me O
think O
i O
ll O
buy O
a O
pc O
next O
time O
. O

three O
years O
is O
a O
decent O
life O
, O
but O
this O
must O
make O
it O
to O
graduation O
and O
beyond O
. O

i O
work O
on O
a O
pc O
at O
home O
and O
have O
used O
pc O
all O
through O
college O
. O

toshiba O
will O
not O
acknowledge O
this O
problem O
. O

then O
it O
ceased O
charging B
at O
all O
. O

an O
absolutely O
hateful O
machine O
that O
no O
one O
should O
get O
of O
their O
own O
free O
will O
. O

i O
do O
not O
experience O
a O
lot O
of O
heat B
coming O
out O
of O
it O
, O
however O
i O
would O
highly O
suggest O
purchasing O
a O
stand B
however O
, O
due O
to O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
design B
of O
the O
macbook O
as O
it O
is O
one O
very O
large O
heat B
sink B
. O

webcam O
is O
a O
bit O
laggy O
, O
not O
the O
greatest O
. O

i O
am O
not O
much O
of O
a O
computer O
techie O
, O
so O
i O
can O
understand O
some O
of O
the O
internal O
problems O
, O
though O
i O
do O
have O
trend B
micro B
as O
an O
antiviral B
program B
. O

stay O
away O
from O
hp O
. O

the O
computer O
continued O
to O
give O
me O
issues O
and O
in O
late O
june O
it O
completely O
died O
again O
and O
i O
tried O
to O
call O
acer O
again O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
and O
they O
refused O
to O
help O
me O
, O
they O
said O
my O
warrenty B
was O
up O
and O
hung O
up O
on O
me O
. O

i've O
haven't O
had O
any O
major O
problems O
with O
the O
laptop O
except O
that O
the O
plastic B
piece B
that O
covers O
the O
usb B
port B
wires B
have O
all O
come O
off O
. O

wonderful O
sleek O
case B
design B
is O
only O
on O
the O
outside O
. O

it O
is O
speedy O
when O
connected O
wirelessly O
to O
any O
network O
regardless O
if O
the O
connection B
is O
weak O
or O
not O
. O

i O
like O
it O
! O

the O
pricing B
is O
very O
competitive O
. O

so O
we O
got O
a O
good O
deal O
on O
hsn O
for O
an O
ascer O
notebook O
and O
we O
bought O
it O
for O
him O
. O

connecting O
to O
my O
wireless B
router O
via O
built O
in O
wireless B
took O
no O
time O
at O
all O
. O

its O
still O
going O
. O

this O
computer O
is O
exceptionally O
thin O
for O
it's O
screen B
size B
and O
processing B
power B
. O

there O
is O
no O
way O
i O
will O
buy O
a O
lg O
product O
in O
the O
future O
. O

i O
have O
not O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
applications B
quitting O
or O
freezing O
. O

prior O
to O
this O
computer O
, O
i O
owned O
a O
powerbook O
g4 O
for O
<number> O
years O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
for O
a O
laptop O
. O

maybe O
this O
is O
virus O
related O
, O
maybe O
not O
, O
but O
the O
computer O
has O
locked O
up O
many O
times O
, O
and O
on O
two O
occasions O
, O
the O
screen B
has O
simply O
gone O
black O
. O

the O
advantages O
of O
owning O
'a O
'mac O
are O
numerous O
. O

i O
challenge O
anyone O
to O
show O
proof O
that O
through O
anywhere O
near O
normal O
use O
can O
get O
more O
than O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
hrs O
out O
of O
it O
. O

using O
this O
machine O
is O
like O
a O
mild O
form O
of O
torture O
. O

this O
wiped O
out O
several O
programs B
that O
were O
installed O
on O
the O
computer O
when O
it O
was O
bought O
. O

on O
the O
twelfth O
day O
that O
i O
had O
the O
notebook O
, O
i O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
dell's O
website O
and O
update O
it O
. O

the O
computer O
blinks O
it O
shuts O
off O
at O
will O
. O

excellent O
product O
for O
the O
money O
. O

it's O
graphics B
aren't O
bad O
at O
all O
, O
for O
the O
lower O
end O
of O
the O
macbook O
pro O
spectrum O
, O
easily O
capable O
of O
running O
starcraft O
ii O
and O
other O
games O
with O
comparable O
graphics B
. O

i O
have O
vista O
, O
so O
i O
am O
unable O
to O
install B
and O
uninstall O
some O
programs B
. O

the O
screen B
is O
bright O
and O
vivid O
and O
the O
keyboard B
is O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
very O
important O
for O
use O
quick O
typers O
. O

i O
can O
do O
everything O
i O
could O
before O
, O
only O
faster O
and O
more O
efficiently O
. O

i O
called O
toshiba O
and O
they O
want O
me O
to O
be O
without O
my O
laptop O
for O
about O
two O
weeks O
while O
they O
look O
at O
the O
problem O
. O

the O
mouse B
jumps O
around O
all O
the O
time O
and O
it O
clicks O
stuff O
i O
dont O
want O
it O
too O
. O

i O
dont O
understand O
why O
i O
spent O
twice O
as O
much O
to O
get O
a O
laptop O
rather O
than O
a O
desktop O
when O
my O
lap O
top O
is O
completely O
immoble O
. O

for O
those O
that O
care O
about O
noise B
this O
thing O
doesn't O
really O
make O
any O
; O

here O
we O
are O
another O
year O
later O
and O
the O
computer O
is O
doing O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

despite O
the O
plethora O
of O
problems O
, O
i O
managed O
to O
use O
technological O
trickery O
to O
keep O
the O
machine O
operational O
for O
two O
years O
. O

i O
had O
my O
iworks O
, O
itunes O
, O
email O
, O
ms O
office O
, O
network O
and O
printers O
set O
up O
and O
completely O
working O
perfectly O
within O
an O
hour O
. O

simply O
amazing O
computer O
! O
! O

i O
first O
purchased O
this O
dell O
model O
<number> O
on O
april O
<number> O
, O
<number> O

the O
macbooks O
are O
small O
enough O
to O
be O
very O
portable O
yet O
hold O
tons O
of O
information O
and O
performance B
. O

two O
times O
with O
in O
one O
month O
. O

the O
only O
downfall O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
software B
i O
have O
won't O
work O
with O
mac O
and O
iwork O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
price B
of O
it O
. O

waited O
on O
getting O
this O
computer O
, O
but O
it O
has O
been O
a O
great O
change O
. O

for O
my O
burn O
thigh O
which O
has O
put O
a O
permanent O
mark O
on O
my O
skin O
it O
happened O
<number> O
months O
ago O
they O
offered O
me O
an O
itouch O
8gig O
you O
know O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
insulating O
when O
a O
company O
this O
rich O
, O
offer O
a O
loyal O
customer O
like O
me O
, O
a O
bottom O
of O
their O
product O
line O
as O
a O
gift O
for O
events O
like O
this O
. O

whenever O
tried O
to O
turn O
it O
on O
, O
it O
would O
restart O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
bios O
launched O
windows O
or O
winblows O
, O
as O
i O
like O
ot O
call O
it O
. O

but O
there's O
this O
application B
called O
boot O
camp O
which O
allows O
you O
to O
add O
another O
os O
x O
like O
windows O
. O

the O
mousepad B
is O
a O
huge O
pain O
in O
the O
arse O
! O

i O
hope O
to O
edit O
this O
in O
the O
next O
few O
hours O
, O
i O
am O
going O
to O
try O
to O
install O
my O
own O
copy O
of O
windows O
<number> O
. O

if O
it's O
not O
shipped O
on O
the O
next O
business O
day O
, O
called O
on O
a O
friday O
they O
are O
closed O
on O
weekends O
, O
what O
was O
the O
next O
step O
. O

i O
also O
purchased O
applecare O
for O
<number> O
, O
which O
is O
a O
three O
year O
extended B
warranty B
, O
since O
i O
ve O
never O
seen O
any O
laptop O
that O
lasted O
more O
than O
two O
. O

i O
have O
had O
the O
netbook O
for O
<number> O
months O
and O
i O
love O
it O
, O
i O
read O
some O
reviews O
that O
say O
netbooks O
are O
slow O
but O
it O
does O
not O
seem O
any O
slower O
than O
the O
other O
computers O
i O
use O
. O

i O
run O
windows B
via O
bootcamp B
for O
the O
couple O
programs B
i O
do O
not O
want O
to O
buy O
a O
mac O
version O
of O
, O
like O
my O
cad B
programs B
. O

c'mon O
, O
lg O
. O

whenever O
i O
call O
dell O
about O
an O
unrelated O
problem O
, O
they O
ask O
me O
if O
my O
laptop O
is O
running O
slowly O
and O
if O
i'd O
like O
to O
purchase O
more O
memory B
for O
<number> O
. O

since O
then O
i O
have O
had O
minor O
problems O
with O
slow O
operation B
. O

if O
you O
faintly O
come O
close O
to O
touching O
this O
thing O
while O
typing O
, O
all O
craziness O
may O
break O
loose O
. O

registration O
1st O
use B
is O
easy O
. O

i O
love O
this O
laptop O
, O
and O
use O
it O
everyday O
to O
do O
something O
, O
and O
never O
lets O
me O
down O
. O

finally O
was O
able O
to O
reach O
a O
young O
lady O
in O
california O
and O
ordered O
the O
machine O
and O
was O
subsequently O
given O
a O
delivery O
date O
. O

i O
definitely O
will O
buy O
a O
mac O
again O
if O
and O
when O
this O
computer O
ever O
fails O
. O

the O
toshiba O
mini O
notebook O
, O
model O
nb O
<number> O
n410bl O
, O
is O
a O
great O
little O
computer O
. O

take O
your O
time O
and O
go O
through O
the O
tutorials B
patiently O
. O

so O
if O
anyones O
looking O
to O
buy O
a O
computer O
or O
laptop O
you O
should O
stay O
far O
far O
away O
from O
any O
that O
have O
the O
name O
toshiba O
on O
it O
. O
. O
. O

i'm O
an O
excellent O
touch O
typist O
, O
and O
my O
hands O
are O
very O
sensitive O
, O
too O
. O

this O
time O
the O
mouse B
pad B
and O
right B
click B
key B
wouldn't O
work O
! O

eventually O
we O
pushed O
hard O
enough O
to O
convince O
them O
that O
this O
was O
the O
machine O
that O
was O
causing O
the O
problems O
. O

the O
first O
full B
charge B
of O
this O
battery B
got O
me O
only O
about O
<number> O
full B
hours O
. O

i O
bought O
a O
cordless B
mouse B
for O
it O
, O
but O
don't O
always O
take O
it O
out O
; O

when O
i O
got O
it O
, O
i O
immediately O
noticed O
that O
it O
was O
quite O
heavy O
and O
thick O
and O
not O
really O
attractive O
. O

it O
is O
sleek O
, O
smooth O
, O
and O
lightweight O
. O

i O
am O
a O
huge O
computer O
person O
i O
love O
anykind O
of O
computer O
that O
works O
well O
, O
but O
when O
i O
got O
this O
one O
i O
was O
so O
happy O
with O
the O
way O
it O
works O
and O
how O

runs B
its O
amazing O
. O

it O
took O
toshiba O
tech B

and O
<number> O
different O
techs B
to O
correct O
the O
problem O
. O

they O
only O

a O
little O
over O
an O
hour O
. O

now O
they O
are O
believers O
in O
the O
product O
. O

had O
to O
have O
this O
computer O
repaired O
twice O
in O
the O
first O
<number> O
months O
after O
purchasing O
it O
. O

hewlett O
packard O
hp O
pavillion O
dv6000 O
laptop O
is O
the O
worst O
laptop O
we O
have O
ever O
bought O
. O

i O
had O
never O
owned O
a O
mac O
before O
; O

the O
<number> O
usb O
ports B
are O
nice O
, O
but O
the O
two O
on O
the O
side O
only O
work O
now O
and O
then O
. O

i O
could O
not O
find O
a O
phone O
number O
anywhere O
to O
call O
an O
actual O
live O
person O
for O
tech B
support B
and O
had O
to O
result O
the O
their O
online B
chat B
. O

i O
try O
to O
use O
it O
today O
and O
i O
can't O
logon O
. O

keyboard O
could O
use O
some O
trimming O
. O

the O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
this O
laptop O
just O
isn't O
worth O
it O
. O

i O
returned O
the O
computer O
to O
hp O
and O
they O
kept O
it O
for O
<number> O
months O
. O

its O
white O
color B
is O
stylish O
for O
college O
students O
and O
easy O
to O
take O
to O
carry O
and O
take O
to O
classes O
. O

returned O
laptop O
for O
repair O
a O
2nd O
time O
and O
it O
came O
back O
with O
obvious O
physical O
damage O
keyboard B
bulging O
and O
speaker B
grill B
pressed O
in O
, O
buttons B
not O
working O
and O
usb O
ports B
inoperative O
. O

when O
i O
am O
next O
to O
my O

full B
service B
, O
on O

. O

i O
got O
assurances O
from O
<number> O
different O
people O
that O
the O
remaining O
<number> O
months O
of O
my O
warranty B
would O
transfer O
to O
the O
new O
computer O
. O

pretty O
disappointed O
about O
this O
product O
. O

the O
letter B
a O
stopped O
working O
after O
the O
first O
week O
. O

by O
the O
time O
i O
was O
finally O
able O
to O
get O
a O
work O
order O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
i O
had O
been O
without O
my O
computer O
for O
almost O
a O
week O
while O
i O
was O
an O
online O
college O
student O
, O
so O
it O
was O
very O
inconvenient O
and O
i O
had O
to O
send O
it O
off O
and O
be O
without O
it O
while O
it O
was O
being O
fixed O
also O
. O

it O
out O
performs O
any O
other O
laptop O
on O
the O
market O
today O
. O

this O
is O
what O
i O
call O
a O
good O
after B
sales B
service B
. O

maybe O
it's O
acer O
, O
maybe O
it's O
msft O
. O

so O
if O
you O
want O
a O
good O
machine O
that O
does O
almost O
anything O
this O
is O
the O
one O
, O
if O
you O
want O
a O
low O
budget O
computer O
then O
look O
at O
the O
other O
great O
brands O
best O
buy O
sells O
. O

i O
took O
off O
a O
star O
because O
the O
machine O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
junk O
software B
on O
it O
. O

i O
would O
buy O
one O
of O
these O
for O
every O
person O
in O
my O
office O
if O
i O
could O
. O

with O

i O
have O
never O

spent O
more O
time O
waiting O
for O
it O
to O
unfreeze O
then O
actually O
doing O
what O
i O
got O
on O
there O
for O
! O

this O
a O
starter O
notebook O
. O

no O
i O
am O
generous O
calling O
it O
slow O
. O

the O
downside O
to O
this O
netbook O
is O
pretty O
much O
the O
same O
for O
any O
netbook O
screen B
size B
is O
not O
something O
i'd O
stare O
at O
for O
the O
entire O
<number> O
<number> O
hours O
of O
battery B
life B
five O
days O
a O
week O
. O

the O
graphics B
are O
great O
. O

all O
in O
all O
, O
i O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
product O
for O
nearly O
everyone O
. O

in O
<number> O
months O
the O
connect B
quality B
got O
worse O
and O
worse O
. O

the O
big O
screen B
allows O
you O
to O
enjoy O
watching O
movies O
, O
pictures O
and O
etc O
! O

the O
headphone B
and O
mic B
jack B
are O
in O
front O
of O
touch O
pad O
making O
the O
touch O
pad O
hard O
to O
use O
when O
using O
headphones B
mic B
, O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
laptop O
was O
designed O
for O
right O
handed O
person O
. O

for O
the O
price B
special O
offer O
this O
is O
a O
great O
laptop O
. O

i O
have O
had O
at O
least O
eight O
toshiba O
laptops O
, O
and O
they O
have O
been O
outstanding O
, O
including O
this O
one O
. O

i O
called O
back O
to O
ensure O
that O
received O
it O
, O
they O
had O
. O

the O
manufacturer's O
warranty B
only O
covers O
replacement O
repair O
of O
parts O
. O

what O
i'd O
like O
is O
for O
the O
laptop O
to O
run B
well O
without O
having O
to O
purchase O
additional O
memory B
. O

if O
you O
can O
afford O
a O
new O
laptop O
, O
and O
are O
in O
the O
market O
for O
one O
, O
of O
course O
, O
then O
definitely O
go O
for O
this O
. O

got O
the O
computer O
back O
a O
month O
later O
and O
it O
was O
still O
broken O
sent O
it O
out O
again O
and O
they O
repaired O
it O
. O

it O
works B
exactly O
like O
it O
did O
the O
day O
i O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

now O
, O
the O
next O
issue O
i O
had O
freaked O
me O
out O
. O

i O
love O
ths O
notebook O
. O

it O
is O
fast O
booting B
up B
, O
shutting B
down B
, O
and O
connection B
with B
the B
internet B
. O

the O
battery B
life B
is O
great O
. O

this O
is O
not O
a O
serious O
gaming B
laptop O
or O
a O
serious O
media O
machine O
; O

even O
if O
apple O
replaces O
whatever O
needs O
replacing O
i O
wonder O
if O
, O
since O
i O
seem O
to O
be O
doubling O
the O
amount O
of O
time O
i O
get O
out O
of O
it O
each O
time O
it's O
like O
new O
, O
i O
might O
have O
<number> O
months O
next O
time O
. O

i O
got O
this O
laptop O
on O
black O
friday O
. O

they O
replaced O
my O
hard B
drive B
as O
well O
as O
my O
mother B
board B
. O

i O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
it O
. O

it O
was O
just O
one O
problem O
after O
another O
for O
me O
, O
and O
that's O
reason O
we O
had O
forked O
out O
so O
much O
money O
was O
so O
we O
wouldn't O
have O
anything O
to O
worry O
about O
. O

there O
is O
nothing O
to O
complain O
about O
the O
system B
. O

and O
it O
comes O
with O
the O
new O
osx O
that O
comes O
with O
new O
features B
that O
makes O
the O
use B
more O
easy O
. O

maybe O
not O
the O
cutting O
edge O
satellite O
l455d O
but O
it O
is O
a O
workhorse O
. O

but O
the O
macbook O
is O
the O
best O
! O

now O
the O
screen B
is O
going O
darker O
, O
darker O
, O
darker O
. O

either O
the O
computer O
is O
too O
slow O
to O
detect O
the O
keys O
typed O
this O
is O
unlikely O
as O
i O
am O
a O
slow O
typist O
or O
the O
keyboard O
simply O
does O
not O
detect O
the O
keys O
being O
typed O
. O

i O
got O
the O
black O
macbook O
two O
years O
ago O
and O
have O
never O
regretted O
it O
. O

as O
a O
graphic O
arts O
a O
retired O
instructor O
i O
still O
love O
to O
play O
with O
the O
graphic O
with O
photos O
and O
clip O
art O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O

my O
wife O
also O
has O
problems O
with O
her O
asus O
different O
model O
. O

features O
such O
as O
the O
dashboard O
allows O
you O
to O
view O
frequently O
used O
tools O
like O
a O
calculator O
, O
weather O
forecast O
, O
movie O
times O
, O
calendar O
, O
computer O
post O
its O
etc O
. O

this O
computer O
is O
the O
ideal O
college O
companion O
. O

both O
computers O
started O
acting O
extremely O
slow O
within O
the O
first O
year O
of O
owning O
them O
. O

the O
macbook O
pro O
is O
very O
sturdy O
and O
versatile O
. O

when O
i O
called O
to O
have O
another O
one O
shipped O
or O
to O
get O
my O
money O
back O
they O
said O
the O
return B
policy B
is O
<number> O
twenty O
three O
days O
from O
the O
date O
of O
purchase O
. O

bought O
from O
wal O
mart O
, O
i O
believe O
that O
this O
laptop O
was O
a O
repaired O
item O
. O

couldnt O
not O
use O
it O
. O

i O
sent O
it O
back O
and O
found O
this O
time O
that O
the O
battery B
was O
faulty O
, O
so O
i O
got O
a O
new O
one O
and O
some O
other O
fixes O
they O
found O
. O

i O
swear O
they O
design O
these O
things O
to O
go O
to O
crap O
after O
a O
year O
so O
you O
are O
stuck O
and O
have O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
one O
. O

great O
pick O
for O
portability B
and O
affordability B
. O

it's O
fast O
, O
it's O
easy O
easy O
easy O
to B
set B
up B
, O
easy O
to B
hook B
to B
my B
wireless B
network B
. O

i O
previously O
purchased O
a O
<number> O
macbook O
had O
pro O
specs B
and O
was O
aluminum B
style B
which O
had O
a O
nvidia B
<number> O
if O
i O
am O
not O
mistaken O
and O
it O
had O
major O
heating O
issues O
. O

they O
didn't O
even O
try O
to O
assist O
me O
or O
even O
offer O
a O
replacement O
. O

we O
used O
pc O
products O
it O
seemed O
simpler O
to O
continue O
with O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

the O
people O
there O
just O
changed O
for O
me O
on O
the O
spot O
and O
i O
got O
a O
new O
arm B
piece B
and O
they O
didn't O
even O
request O
for O
a O
receipt O
. O

i O
love O
my O
samsung O
tv O
and O
galaxy O
s O
smartphone O
, O
but O
this O
netbook O
was O
a O
very O
poor O
computer O
. O

i O
made O
a O
perfect O
decision O
when O
i O
bought O
the O
toshiba O
! O

i O
take O
it O
everywhere O
with O
me O
because O
it's O
so O
easy O
to O
carry B
. O

the O
only O
thing O
is O
that O
the O
battery B
won't O
last O
more O
than O
<number> O
<number> O
an O
hour O
. O

it O
still O
heats O
up O
like O
mad O
and O
i O
am O
unable O
to O
use O
it O
with O
the O
computer O
directly O
on O
my O
lap O
for O
more O
than O
five O
to O
ten O
minutes O
at O
a O
time O
. O

the O
first O
fell O
apart O
right O
after O
the O
<number> O
year O
warranty O
. O

i O
am O
finding O
my O
way O
around O
this O
laptop O
better O
than O
my O
last O
one O
. O

they O
told O
me O
it O
was O
my O
loss O
even O
though O
it O
was O
the O
computer O
, O
not O
what O
i've O
done O
. O

i O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
macbook O
. O

about O
<number> O
months O
ago O
i O
bought O
the O
<number> O
macbook O
pro O
, O
which O
was O
an O
upgrade O
from O
my O
<number> O
macbook O
pro O
. O

let's O
just O
get O
this O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
i O
love O
apple O
! O

oh O
and O
it O
has O
word B
and O
stuff O
but O
its O
a O
trial O
verion O
so O
after O
about O
a O
month O
or O
so O
when O
you O
go O
to O
open O
it O
it O
asks O
for O
a O
product O
key O
which O
didnt O
come O
with O
the O
computer O
and O
even O
after O
clicking O
cancel O
it O
wont O
let O
you O
use O
it O
at O
all O
i O
use O
the O
old O
word B
processer B
which O
works O
good O
. O

the O
keyboard B
has O
a O
wonderful O
nature O
feel O
. O

they O
went O
through O
asking O
me O
open O
up O
various O
components O
, O
taking O
battery B
out O
, O
hard B
disk B
apart O
, O
and O
after O
<number> O
hours O
on O
phone O
could O
not O
fix O
it O
. O

<number> O
weeks O
after O
giving O
the O
computer O
for O
repair O
annoyed O
at O
machouse O
amsterdam O
, O
decided O
to O
send O
complaint O
email O
to O
apple O
. O

while O
there O
are O
occasions O
that O
my O
computer O
will O
freeze O
or O
will O
need O
to O
be O
manually O
shut O
down O
, O
this O
occurs O
far O
less O
frequently O
than O
on O
pc O
computers O
and O
laptops O
that O
i've O
used O
. O

bought O
with O
a O
credit O
card O
. O

the O
battery B
doesn't O
last O
long O
but O
i'm O
sure O
an O
upgrade O
battery B
would O
solve O
that O
problem O
. O

i O
was O
looking O
too O
closely O
at O
the O
other O
performance B
specs B
and O
while O
comparing O
, O
i O
took O
it O
for O
granted O
that O
these O
features B
were O
standard O
. O

i O
did O
a O
lot O
of O
research O
and O
ended O
up O
thinking O
this O
toshiba O
was O
the O
best O
one O
for O
me O
. O

i've O
had O
it O
now O
about O
<number> O
months O
and O
absolutely O
love O
it O
. O

i O
have O
no O
idea O
how O
this O
could O
have O
even O
gotten O
past O
quality B
control B
during O
production O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
last O
week O
, O
and O
the O
very O
next O
day O
had O
to O
return O
it O
because O
it O
over O
heated O
and O
the O
touch O
mouse O
stopped O
responding O
. O

i O
am O
so O
happy O
to O
have O
purchased O
this O
computer O
. O

oh O
yea O
, O
has O
no O
numeric B
pad B
on O
the O
side O
. O

the B
cover B
for B
the B
dvd O
drive B
soon O
came O
off O
, O
too O
a O
mark O
of O
poor O
construction B
quality B
. O

i O
returned O
the O
2nd O
laptop O
for O
a O
full O
refund O
. O

really O
no O
problems O
with O
the O
hand O
me O
down O
computers O
i O
received O
from O
my O
children O
. O

i O
did O
not O
take O
the O
class O
and O
wish O
that O
i O
would O
have O
. O

it O
would O
be O
a O
load O
on O
long O
trips O
where O
a O
lot O
of O
walking O
is O
required O
. O

but O
the O
arm B
velcro B
is O
torn O
after O
one O
use O
. O

not O
good O
for O
a O
person O
who O
gets O
online O
daily O
. O

the O
laptop O
was O
returned O
but O
audio O
issue O
was O
not O
fixed O
. O

i O
can't O
even O
remember O
how O
i O
finally O
got O
it O
taken O
care O
of O
, O
but O
i O
was O
done O
with O
sony O
after O
that O
! O

so O
it O
was O
only O
about O
<number> O
weeks O
ago O
. O

i O
just O
love O
this O
lap O
top O
, O
i O
just O
wish O
it O
were O
all O
silver O
or O
they O
had O
all O
black O
. O

the O
software B
is O
amazing O
. O

we O
carry O
the O
netbook O
around O
here O
and O
there O
, O
hence O
it's O
kinda O
of O
irritating O
when O
the O
lcd O
just O
slide O
downwards O
. O

there O
is O
nothing O
better O
. O

i O
now O
own O
another O
hewlitt O

and O
at O
least O
<number> O
or O
<number> O
other O
programs B
with O
next O
to O
no O
slowdown O
. O

the O
battery B
life B
is O
amazing O
, O
the O
versitility B
is O
outstanding O
. O

it O
is O
known O
as O
safari O
, O
and O
if O
you O
are O
doing O
any O
website O
work O
, O
you O
should O
know O
that O
many O
hosting O
companies O
do O
not O
support O
it O
. O

vista O
is O
a O
nightmare O
. O

i O
spent O
eight O
hundred O
dollars O
from O
a O
giant O
paper O
weight O
that O
looks O
good O
on O
a O
bus O
. O

i O
have O
used O
a O
couple O
of O
others O
on O
the O
job O
as O
well O
. O

the O
program B
came O
with O
the O
computer O
and O
works O
beautifully O
. O

posted O
nov O
<number> O
, O
<number> O
two O
weeks O
ago O
i O
bought O
this O
notebook O
. O

acer O
won't O
replace O
the O
laptop O
. O

i O
am O
also O
upset O
with O
cr O
for O
giving O
a O
good O
rating O
. O

the O
hinge B
design B
forced O
you O
to O
place O
various O
connections O
all O
around O
the O
computer O
, O
left O
right O
and O
front O
. O

i O
have O
owned O
macbook O
pros O
since O
<number> O
and O
this O
is O
the O
best O
yet O
! O

i O
was O
loving O
this O
netbook O
because O
it O
had O
an O
amazing O
screen B
and O
display B
and O
was O
small O
and O
light O
, O
but O
after O
<number> O
week O
it O
stopped O
openning O
web O
pages O
for O
me O
even O
after O
installing O
new O
browsers B
then O
eventually O
it O
just O
started O
giving O
me O
a O
blue O
screen B
and O
crashing O
everytime O
i O
booted O
it O
. O

now O
i O
could O
get O
myself O
a O
cheap O
computer O
, O
that O
will O
probably O
work O
a O
whole O
lot O
better O
! O

i O
would O
definitely O
not O
go O
back O
to O
using O
a O
pc O
after O
using O
the O
mac O
. O

the O
so O
called O
laptop O
runs O
to O
slow O
and O
i O
hate O
it O
! O

this O
is O
the O
first O
laptop O
i've O
owned O
, O
althougth O
i O
used O
several O
at O
my O
previous O
job O
. O

those O
moments O
in O
thime O
where O
you O
want O
to O
throw O
something O
against O
the O
wall O
? O
yeah O
, O
i O
wanted O
to O
throw O
that O
lap O
top O
out O
the O
window O
and O
light O
it O
on O
fire O
. O

charger O
seems O
large O
for O
this O
class O
of O
computer O
. O

i O
don't O
really O
have O
a O
complaint O
. O

i'm O
pretty O
sure O
it's O
not O
newegg's O
fault O
but O
when O
you O
turn O
on O
a O
computer O
you O
just O
bought O
you O
want O
it O
to O
at O
least O
get O
to O
desktop O
. O

best O
buy O
ended O
up O
junking O
the O
computer O
and O
giving O
me O
a O
replacement O
computer O
. O

i O
dislike O
the O
quality O
and O
the O
placement O
of O
the O
speakers B
. O

the O
screen B
graphics B
and O
clarity B
, O
and O
sharpness B
are O
great O
. O

if O
i O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
any O
of O
my O
apple O
items O
i O
make O
an O
appointment O
at O
one O
of O
my O
local O
stores O
and O
they O
work O
on O
correcting O
it O
right O
there O
. O

so O
i O
called O
customer B
support B
which O
is O
good O
too O
and O
they O
went O
through O
it O
and O
it O
is O
just O
a O
safety B
feature B
and O
it O
does O
not O
affect O
performance B
at O
all O
, O
i O
just O
chose O
to O
hide O
the O
message O
. O

i O
claim O
that O
this O
has O
no O
value O
to O
me O
, O
the O
laptop O
was O
new O
anyway O
. O

enough O
said O
. O

not O
working O
bad O

i O
would O
really O
recommend O
to O
any O
person O
out O
there O
to O
get O
this O
laptop O
cause O
its O
really O
worth O
it O
. O

otherwise O
this O
little O
notebook O
has O
met O
all O
my O
expectations O
. O

my O
son O
said O
it O
popped O
up O
and O
he O
clicked O
update O
. O

i O
lost O
two O
items O
i O
was O
working O
on O
until O
i O
figured O
out O
what O
was O
happening O
. O

the O
unibody B
design B
is O
edgy O
and O
durable O
. O

stopped O
booting O
up O
less O
than O
a O
week O
after O
my O
one O
year O
warranty B
was O
up O
. O

but O
, O
for O
the O
cost B
this O
is O
a O
winner O
. O

let O
me O
tell O
you O
, O
this O
machine O
is O
great O
. O

i O
have O
used O
a O
computer O
at O
work O
but O
having O
your O
own O
personal O
laptop O
is O
awsome O
! O

later O
it O
held O
zero O
charge B
and O
its O
replacement O
worked O
for O
less O
than O
three O
months O
. O

the O
second O
issue O
i O
had O
with O
it O
occured O
a O
month O
later O
and O
it O
kept O
overheating O
, O
even O
if O
on O
for O
less O
than O
an O
hour O
! O

also O
, O
the O
battery B
does O
not O
last O
very O
long O
at O
all O
. O

good O
luck O
with O
your O
purchase O
options O
. O

buy O
this O
if O
you O
like O
being O
tortured O
, O
teased O
, O
frustrated O
and O
wasting O
twice O
as O
much O
time O
as O
you O
spent O
using O
your O
old O
mac O
. O

very O
disappointed O
! O

they O
are O
asking O
me O
to O
ship O
the O
unit O
back O
to O
fix O
it O
at O
their O
site O
. O

i O
bought O
it O
from O
hsn O
because O
it O
was O
bundled O
with O
extra O
software B
, O
but O
as O
it O
turns O
out O
, O
that O
software B
just O
crashes O
it O
more O
often O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O

i O
looked O
around O
and O
based O
off O
my O
price B
features B
comparison O
from O
a O
brand O
i O
trusted O
i O
landed O
here O
. O

i O
constantly O
had O
to O
send O
my O
laptop O
in O
for O
services B
every O
<number> O
months O
and O
it O
always O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
same O
problem O
that O
they O
said O
they O
had O
already O
fixed O
. O

strong O
performance B
in O
this O
device O
makes O
use B
of O
fun O
and O
a O
strong O
sense O
of O
the O
era O
of O
speed B
this O
device O
serves O
all O
modern O
requirements O
is O
a O
very O
strong O
game O
and O
is O
very O
useful O
for O
designers O
. O

unless O
you O
need O
the O
bluetooth O
<number> O
. O

i O
was O
sorly O
disapointed O
to O
discover O
that O
hp O
what O
i O
thought O
was O
a O
reputable O
company O
wouldn't O
honor O
the O
warrenty B
when O
the O
fan B
blade B
fell O
apart O
. O

that O
is O
pretty O
sad O
when O
they O
name O
them O
specifically O
. O

more O
times O
that O
not O
the O
screen O
pops O
up O
saying O
i O
have O
a O
bad O
internet B
connection B
, O
or O
the O
page O
can't O
be O
displayed O
. O

no O
viruses O
. O

it O
is O
everything O
that O
i O
would O
want O
in O
a O
computer O
. O

do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
invest O
in O
a O
few O
external B
harddrives B
if O
you O
are O
planning O
on O
purchasing O
this O
laptop O
. O

however O
, O
if O
i O
sound O
enthusiastic O
about O
this O
, O
i O
am O
! O

you O
will O
fall O
in O
love O
with O
it O
in O
no O
time O
. O

i O
give O
this O
laptop O
a O
five O
star O
review O
i O
love O
it O
and O
it O
has O
done O
chams O
for O
me O
. O

they O
removed O
them O
and O
returned O
the O
computer O
to O
me O
. O

i O
don't O
understand O
why O
only O
windows O
<number> O
starter O
is O
included O
. O

on O
<number> O
july O
<number> O
, O
i O
purcased O
this O
model O
at O
best O
buy O
for O
about O
<number> O

i O
went O
with O
him O
and O
we O
picked O
this O
one O
. O

while O
most O
people O
say O
that O
pcs O
hold O
functionality B
and O
value B
and O
macs O
are O
just O
pretty O
to O
look B
at O
, O
i O
think O
there's O
something O
to O
be O
said O
about O
the O
simplicity B
of O
macs O
. O

this O
is O
my O
second O
macbook O
pro O
and O
it's O
better O
than O
ever O
. O

my O
macbook O
is O
so O
much O
better O
looking B
and O
so O
thin O
! O

the O
notebook O
would O
not O
turn O
back O
on O
again O
. O

the O
ease O
of O
use B
is O
wonderful O
. O

this O
system O
came O
loaded O
with O
windows O
<number> O
starter O
. O

when O
battery B
life B
went O
to O
<number> O
hours O
or O
less O
, O
took O
it O
to O
the O
machouse O
amsterdam O
for O
repair O
26th O
of O
august O
. O

the O
battery B
gets O
so O
hot O
it O
is O
scary O
. O

best O
thing O
is O
i O
can O
use O
existing O
<number> O
bit O
old O
programs B
. O

it's O
so O
nice O
to O
look B
at O
and O
the O
keys B
are O
easy O
to O
type O
with O
. O

the O
apple O
macbook O
pro O
nothing O
to O
say O
butprofessionally O
great O
and O
outstanding O
. O

it's O
also O
very O
energy O
efficient O
, O
running O
on O
a O
quarter O
of O
the O
power O
it O
takes O
to O
run O
a O
<number> O
watt O
lightbulb O
. O

i O
am O
forever O
changed O
and O
will O
no O
longer O
buy O
a O
windows O
based O
machine O
for O
personal O
use O
. O

mom O
, O
dad O
, O
brother O
, O
sister O
, O
you O
name O
it O
! O

but O
it O
came O
back O
in O
even O
worse O
shape O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
would O
change O
about O
it O
is O
the O
mouse B
keys B
. O

it O
is O
absolutely O
horrible O
to O
use B
, O
despite O
all O
its O
so O
called O
advanced O
features B
. O

before O
, O
i O
reloaded O
with O
windows O
<number> O
ultimate O
and O
used O
only O
the O
downloaded O
drivers B
from O
acer's O
site O
. O

i O
have O
to O
keep O
turning O
it O
until O
it O
decides O
to O
lower O
and O
there O
is O
no O
mute B
. O

it's O
still O
beautiful O
and O
has O
better O
color B
reproduction B
than O
i O
could O
ever O
expect O
from O
a O
notebook O
. O

after O
that O
i O
turned O
to O
email O
in O
my O
next O
vain O
help O
to O
get O
them O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
the O
warranty B
was O
still O
valid O
. O

so O
far O
, O
a O
great O
product O
. O

he O
loves O
it O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
use B
and O
well O
the O
schools O
start O
teaching O
the O
kids O
early O
about O
computers O
so O
it O
was O
easy O
for O
him O
to O
get O
started O
. O

u O
can O
do O
what O
u O
want O
in O
just O
few O
seconds O
, O
even O
to O
start B
up B
your O
computer O
takes O
few O
seconds O
. O

it's O
the O
most O
wonderful O
thing O
in O
the O
entire O
world O
. O

so O
i'd O
pop O
them O
off O
to O
see O
what O
the O
problem O
was O
, O
well O
guess O
what O
? O
the O
darn O
thing O
wouldn't O
go O
back O
on O
. O

also O
, O
macbooks O
come O
with O
much O
more O
features B
which O
are O
so O
cool O
! O

they O
sent O
out O
a O
sony O
'certified' O
technician B
. O

they O
have O
developed O
excellent O
proprietary B
software B
for O
editing O
video O
and O
pictures O
and O
i'm O
looking O
forward O
to O
utilizing O
these O
tools O
on O
the O
regular O
. O

getting O
the O
apple O
care O
plan B
is O
a O
must O
. O

i've O
saved O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
and O
headaches O
so O
far O
, O
using O
my O
new O
macbook O
pro O
. O

overall O
i O
would O
recomend O
this O
to O
anybody O
and O
tell O
them O
that O
if O
they O
want O
to O
burn O
their O
music O
or O
play O
there O
video B
games B
to O
buy O
the O
cd B
drive B
. O

apple O
offers O
to O
send O
replacement O
and O
after O
<number> O
days O
i O
send O
them O
the O
old O
computer O
. O

so O
far O
, O
i O
have O
no O
complaints O
. O

his O
was O
worth O
<number> O
. O

now O
am O
very O
aprehensive O
about O
toshiba O
laptops O
. O

i O
spent O
<number> O
dollars O
on O
a O
top O
of O
the O
line O
laptop O
. O

i O
also O
own O
an O
hp O
notebook O
and O
it O
doesn't O
even O
come O
close O
. O

our O
apple O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
macbook O
pro O
notebook O
computer O
z0j80001 O
notebook O
and O
has O
become O
such O
an O
integral O
part O
of O
completing O
our O
daily O
needs O
and O
social O
networking O
. O

i O
am O
constantly O
trying O
to O
uninstall O
programs B
, O
clean O
cookies O
, O
and O
delete O
unused O
files O
. O

the O
dv4 O
boasted O
a O
faster O
processor B
, O
more O
memory B
, O
and O
a O
bigger O
hard B
drive B
than O
my O
old O
computer O
, O
plus O
a O
better O
quality O
web B
cam B
, O
nicer O
screen B
, O
and O
many O
other O
features B
. O

the O
only O
downfall O
is O
the O
battery B
only O
last O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
hrs O
when O
not O
plugged O
in O
. O

the O
graphics B
on O
this O
computer O
are O
also O
stellar O
very O
clear O
and O
vivid O
. O

aside O
from O
the O
trial B
software B
and O
the O
short O
battery B
life B
, O
lack O
of O
a O
webcam B
, O
its O
great O
. O

as O
a O
die O
hard O
windows O
enthusiast O
, O
i O
shunned O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
mac O
until O
this O
point O
. O

i O
think O
that O
if O
it O
is O
the O
motherboard B
again O
so O
soon O
that O
they O
should O
replace O
it O
. O

if O
this O
computer O
every O
breaks O
down O
on O
me O
i O
will O
most O
definatly O
get O
the O
same O
one O
again O
. O

i O
had O
a O
macbook O
notebook O
, O
and O
it O
had O
absolutely O
no O
protection O
from O
viruses O
, O
spyware O
, O
malware O
, O
etc O
. O

the O
computer O
loads B
in O
about O
a O
<number> O
10th O
of O
the O
time O
that O
my O
pc O
did O
, O
and O
i O
have O
all O
of O
the O
programs B
that O
were O
on O
my O
pc O
. O

i O
made O
the O
right O
decision O
. O

in O
the O
past O
few O
years O
, O
i've O
had O
terrible O
experiences O
with O
hp O
. O

overall O
, O
it's O
ok O
. O

graphics O
are O
clean O
and O
sharp O
, O
internet B
interfaces B
are O
seamless O
. O

the O
newer O
black B
keyboard B
took O
a O
little O
bit O
away O
from O
the O
previous O
gray O
one O
which O
looked O
really O
slick O
, O
but O
it O
is O
still O
a O
great O
notebook O
! O

sony O
parts O
reliability O
and O
quality O
of O
service B
is O
recenlty O
the O
worst O
. O

i O
am O
very O
happy O
! O

as O
with O
any O
laptop O
not O
purchased O
with O
software B
options B
, O
it O
comes O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
what O
i O
consider O
useless O
applications B
. O

its O
office O
compatible O
, O
but O
the O
features B
and O
its O
functioning B
is O
all O
new O
again O
so O
you O
might O
as O
well O
save O
the O
money O
and O
just O
learn O
the O
pre O
installed O
mac O
programs B
. O

i O
occassionaly O
use O
it O
for O
work O
via O
vpn O
and O
it O
has O
not O
given O
me O
any O
problems O
. O

i O
sent O
it O
back O
and O
they O
lost O
it O
. O

it O
just O
works B
flawlessly O
! O

do O
you O
think O
i O
purposely O
destroy O
my O
netbook O
, O
so O
that O
i O
can O
demand O
a O
new O
set O
? O
do O
you O
think O
it's O
fun O
to O
take O
public O
transport O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
service B
center B
and O
get O
a O
non O
satisfactory O
solution O
? O
or O
rather O
no O
solution O
. O

i'm O
having O
the O
laptop O
returned O
unrepaired O
since O
paying O
<number> O
every O
<number> O
months O
just O
isn't O
worth O
it O
that's O
about O
how O
long O
the O
port B
seems O
to O
last O
. O

ok O
first O
. O

so O
if O
you O
move O
laptop O
a O
lot O
, O
it O
might O
get O
loose O
, O
however O
it O
sits O
pretty O
tightly O
. O

another O
satisfied O
customer O
. O

also O
the O
battery B
is O
completely O
shot O
. O

highly O
recommended O
! O

awesome O
cooling B
system B
much O
better O
grafics B
card B
ati O
<number> O
8gb O
ram O
led O
backlit B
screen B
. O
. O
. O

the O
biggest O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
box O
had O
no O
instructions B
in O
it O
. O

but O
after O
using O
it O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
, O
the O
overall O
operation B
is O
poor O
. O

will O
not O
buy O
another O
toshiba O
, O
this O
is O
my O
second O
, O
not O
happy O
w O
either O
. O

compared O
to O
similarly O
spec'd O
pcs O
, O
this O
machine O
is O
good O
value B
, O
well O
built B
and O
works B
easily O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

the O
cool O
thing O
about O
the O
mac O
book O
was O
that O
i O
went O
on O
my O
honeymoon O
and O
shot O
a O
bunch O
of O
pictures O
and O
movies O
with O
my O
iphone O
, O
then O
i O
came O
back O
and O
put O
them O
onto O
my O
macbook O
and O
made O
a O
pretty O
good O
dvd O
movie O
with O
all O
the O
pictures O
and O
videos O
from O
my O
trip O
. O

for O
two O
months O
, O
when O
you O
guessed O
it O
. O

this O
was O
my O
first O
macbook O
purchase O
ever O
. O

screen O
is O
crystal O
clear O
and O
the O
system B
is O
very O
responsive O
. O

i O
will O
stack O
it O
up O
against O
laptops O
that O
cost B
twice O
as O
much O
any O
day O
. O

quite O
simply O
this O
is O
the O
best O
laptop O
i O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O

or O
the O
cursor B
would O
show O
up O
some O
place O
else O
. O

the O
newer O
macbook O
that O
i O
have O
purchased O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
computers O
. O

i O
have O
had O
some O
excellent O
computer O
and O
have O
found O
i O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
to O
do O
with O
them O

as O
it O
turns O
out O
, O
i O
just O
didn't O
know O
any O
better O
. O

i've O
had O
friends O
with O
acers O
who O
seem O
to O
have O
had O
similar O
or O
exact O
same O
problems O
. O

what O
can O
i O
say O
. O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
operate B
and O
i O
have O
already O
ordered O
more O
software B
and O
gadgets B
for O
my O
new O
rolls O
royce O
of O
laptops O
. O

what's O
also O
interesting O
is O
this O
survey O
changed O
my O
ratings O
the O
first O
time O
i O
submitted O
it O
in O
case O
it O
doesn't O
keep O
what O
i O
put O
here O
are O
my O
aratings O

it O
might O
be O
something O
deep O
within O
windows O
, O
for O
i O
was O
unable O
to O
create O
a O
disk B
image B
on O
my O
hard B
drive B
. O

i O
had O
a O
toshiba O
for O
<number> O
years O
. O

the O
track B
pad B
to O
me O
is O
what O
really O
stands O
out O
though O
, O
you O
can O
do O
several O
different O
things O
with O
it O
just O
depending O
on O
how O
many O
fingers O
you O
use O
on O
the O
track B
pad B
, O
awesome O
thinking O
apple O
! O

now O
i O
had O
not O
tried O
to O
use O
this O
since O
the O
disc B
drive B
had O
been O
replaced O
and O
after O
taking O
it O
back O
to O
the O
geek O
squad O
i O
found O
out O
they O
had O
accidently O
not O
used O
the O
right O
drive B
when O
they O
replaced O
the O
first O
one O
, O
so O
back O
it O
went O
to O
get O
the O
correct O
drive B
. O

first O
, O
you O

discover O
that O

just O
plug O

i O
am O
taking O
back O
today O
. O

my O
parents O
bought O
it O
for O
me O
as O
a O
graduation O
gift O
, O
and O
i'm O
totally O
almost O
kind O
of O
maybe O
definitely O
obsessed O
with O
it O
. O

the O
macbook O
is O
way O
too O
overpriced O
for O
something O
so O
simple O
and O
chaotic O
. O

complied O
to O
their O
protocol O
, O
called O
number O
, O
made O
case O
, O
got O
an O
email O
address O
to O
send O
complaint O
. O

the O
os O
takes O
some O
getting O
used O
to O
especially O
after O
being O
a O
windows O
user O
for O
so O
long O
but O
the O
learning O
curve O
is O
so O
worth O
it O
! O

it O
quit O
working O
within O
a O
weeks O
time O
. O

but O
after O
i O
got O
used O
to O
it O
i O
love O
it O
. O

i O
also O
purchased O
iwork O
to O
go O
with O
it O
which O
has O
programs B
for O
word B
processing B
, O
spreadsheets B
, O
and O
presentations B
similar O
to O
microsoft O
office O
. O

after O
<number> O
days O
, O
being O
denied O
<number> O
times O
and O
told O
off O
once O
, O
i O
managed O
to O
get O
through O
and O
was O
able O
to O
send O
them O
a O
scanned O
copy O
of O
the O
receipt O
. O

overall O
, O
i O
experienced O
a O
huge O
change O
in O
that O
my O
mac O
runs B
pretty O
fast O
compared O
to O
my O
old O
pc O
. O

when O
i O
got O
the O
computer O
back O
and O
realizwed O
it O
still O
was O
not O
correct O
hp O
told O
me O
it O
was O
out O
of O
warranty B
and O
now O
it O
was O
my O
problem O
. O

it B
also O
came O
with O
a O
built B
it B
web B
cam B
which O
is O
great O
because O
i O
can O
see O
an O
communicate O
with O
my O
family O
members O
back O
home O
. O

good O
monitor B
and O
performed B
well O
. O

they O
are O
closed O
at O
9pm O
eastern O
. O

in O
those O
three O
years O
, O
i've O
had O
a O
couple O
of O
minor O
problems O
and O
both O
were O
resolved O
by O
apple O
quickly O
and O
easily O
. O

although O
my O
model O
was O
listed O
as O
recalled O
, O
hp O
denied O
my O
claim O
. O

it O
was O
secure O
and O
easy O
to O
navigate B
. O

i O
was O
a O
little O
weary O
at O
purchasing O
another O
<number> O
macbook O
almost O
<number> O
years O
later O
but O
t O
looks O
like O
the O
newer O
macbooks O
have O
gotten O
its O
current O
line O
of O
graphics B
cards B
in O
order O
this O
time O
around O
. O

the O
machine O
has O
a O
bluray B
player B
the O
book B
has O
no O
mention O
of O
it O
or O
how O
to O
connect O
it O
to O
your O
hdtv O
. O

i O
am O
loyal O
to O
apple O
. O

they O
are O
by O
far O
the O
easiest O
systems B
to O
actually O
learn O
about O
computers O
with O
. O

i O
will O
be O
patient O
for O
few O
months O
. O

this O
apple O
navigates O
you O
thru O
the O
unexplored O
world O
of O
the O
internet B
. O

this O
was O
purchased O
for O
my O
daughter O
and O
i O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

finally O
set O
the O
unit O
back O
to O
hp O
after O
a O
month O
of O
hell O
. O

i O
couldn't O
afford O
a O
new O
mac O
, O
so O
i O
bought O
a O
pc O
instead O
. O

the O
video B
card B
is O
great O
for O
media B
, O
and O
above O
average O
for O
gaming B
, O
but O
not O
a O
gamers O
first O
choice O
. O

it O
was O
always O
getting O
froze O
up O
. O

my O
information O
was O
all O
lost O
my O
fault O
, O
i O
know O
, O
but O
i O
never O
thought O
i O
would O
need O
to O
back O
up O
my O
information O
on O
a O
brand O
new O
mac O
, O
the O
paragon O
of O
all O
computers O
! O

but O
no O
one O
could O
tell O
me O
when O
my O
part O
would O
be O
shipped O
nor O
could O
they O
tell O
me O
where O
to O
buy O
it O
on O
their O
website O
! O
! O
! O

i O
got O
the O
blue O
screen O
of O
death O
the O
first O
month O
i O
got O
it O
. O

this O
is O
the O
third O
macbook O
pro O
in O
our O
family O
. O

apple O
continues O
to O
shine O
and O
provide O
a O
much O
more O
enjoyable O
computer O
experience O
! O

i O
had O
of O
course O
bought O
a O
<number> O
year B
warranty B
, O
so O
i O
sent O
it O
in O
to O
be O
replaced O
and O
almost O
<number> O
months O
later O
the O
dv4 O
is O
what O
the O
sent O
me O
as O
a O
replacement O
. O

apparently O
there O
is O
a O
manufacturing O
defect O
, O
something O
with O
the O
amount O
of O
thermal B
paste B
. O

despite O
the O
claims O
of O
the O
apple O
apologists O
a O
vice O
of O
which O
i O
am O
recently O
myself O
reformed O
the O
internals B
of O
mac O
laptops O
are O
no O
different O
from O
pcs' O
at O
this O
point O
. O

took O
several O
hours O
with O
customer B
support B
before O
i O
could O
even O
start O
the O
pc O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

asus O
facial B
recognition B
doesn't O
work O
and O
windows B
logon B
isn't O
either O
. O

windows O
vista O
makes O
this O
computer O
almost O
unusable O
for O
online B
service B
. O

i O
contacted O
acer O
and O
they O
are O
giving O
me O
free O
recovery B
dvds O
, O
so O
don't O
go O
and O
pay O
for O
them O
, O
just O
ask O
for O
them O
and O
they O
should O
give O
them O
to O
you O
. O

now O
when O
i O
order O
i O
did O
not O
go O
full O
scale O
for O
the O
webcam B
or O
full O
keyboard B
i O
wanted O
something O
for O
basics O
of O
being O
easy O
to O
carry B
when O
i O
use O
crutchs O
or O
wheelchair O
and O
with O
a O
backpack O
laptop O
bag O
. O

can O
listen O
to O
my O
music O
and O
watch O
my O
videos O
with O
ease O
and O
with O
a O
great O
display B
. O

otherwise O
, O
all O
other O
features B
are O
a O
<number> O

so O
in O
late O
march O
, O
early O
april O
<number> O
i O
was O
without O
it O
again O
for O
a O
couple O
weeks O
while O
i O
had O
online O
courses O
i O
had O
to O
complete O
and O
my O
fiance O
was O
in O
afghanistan O
and O
web O
conferencing O
was O
the O
best O
communication O
method O
we O
had O
. O

the O
performance B
is O
awesome O
. O

i O
pondered O
very O
long O
over O
this O
decision O
. O

this O
thing O
sucks O
! O

i O
love O
my O
new O
computer O
! O

okay O
, O
let's O
just O
start O
out O
by O
saying O
i O
am O
in O
no O
way O
a O
computer O
techy O
. O

it O
was O
a O
waste O
of O
money O
from O
day O
one O
! O

i'm O
new O
just O
switched O
from O
years O
of O
pc O
frustration O
. O

so O
i O
got O
another O
netbook O
which O
i O
love O
! O

but O
in O
fact O
it O
is O
totally O
the O
opposite O
. O

the O
display B
is O
beyond O
horrible O
. O

he O
left O
me O
, O
instructions O
on O
what O
to O
do O
when O
this O
comes O
up O
, O
or O
that O
comes O
up O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O
. O

it's O
a O
joke O
. O

there O
is O
hardly O
any O
memory B
on O
the O
computer's O
hard B
drive B
. O

actually O
, O
i O
had O
noticed O
the O
one O
on O
the O
sales O
floor O
also O
didn't O
have O
sound B
! O

i O
started O
hainv O
problems O
with O
it O
within O
the O
first O
month O
. O

next O
, O
most O
acer O
laptop O
fans B
are O
on O
the O
bottom O
which O
is O
right O
on O
your O
laptop O
. O

the O
laptop O
preformed B
pretty O
well O
. O

i'm O
honestly O
afraid O
that O
it O
will O
burn O
me O
, O
it's O
that O
hot O
! O

but O
i O
don't O
see O
it O
as O
a O
problem O
. O

numerous O
problems O
over O
the O
next O
<number> O
weeks O
until O
i O
got O
the O
blue O
screen O
of O
death O
and O
had O
to O
send O
the O
pc O
back O
to O
hp O
. O

i O
think O
this O
will O
happen O
to O
any O
new O
version O
of O
computer O
phone O
released O
and O
i O
need O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
next O
set O
of O
updates O
to O
have O
all O
of O
this O
fixed O
. O

this O
one O
has O
had O
the O
same O
effect O
. O

and O
if O
you O
are O
a O
game O
player O
it O
works O
with O
world O
of O
warcraft O
wonderfully O
. O

this O
computer O
is O
absolutely O
amazing O
! O
! O
! O

so O
buyer O
beware O
when O
buying O
toshiba O

i O
found O
this O
laptop O
on O
sale O
for O
under O
<number> O
at O
best O
buy O
which O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
! O

i O
got O
my O
macbook O
pro O
because O
i O
wanted O
to O
do O
all O
the O
stuff O
i O
need O
to O
do O
without O
worrying O
about O
the O
system B
quitting O
on O
me O
or O
freezing O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
. O

i O
love O
the O
apple O
products O
. O

i O
loved O
the O
netbook O
minus O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
windows B
os O
until O
this O
started O
happening O
. O

the O
minute O
you O
fire O
it O
up O
it's O
all O
good O
, O
very O
easy O
user B
interface B
. O

i O
have O
had O
two O
toshiba O
satellite O
computers O
and O
while O
they O
are O
okay O
, O
they O
are O
in O
no O
way O
comparable O
to O
the O
mac O
. O

i O
actually O
contact O
toshiba O
before O
i O
started O
having O
problem O
and O
was O
given O
run O
around O
after O
i O
supplied O
serial O
number O
in O
order O
to O
delay O
me O
sending O
in O
laptop O
until O
after O
warrenty B
expired O
. O

they're O
absolutely O
useless O
, O
unless O
you O
count O
the O
joy O
of O
releasing O
anger O
while O
smashing O
into O
little O
peices O
against O
the O
wall O
. O

was O
a O
great O
deal O
i O
will O
give O
that O
. O

theres O
also O
idvd O
, O
a O
program B
dedicated O
to O
putting O
all O
your O
favorite O
media O
together O
photos O
, O
recordings O
, O
video O
projects O
into O
one O
program B
so O
that O
you O
can O
create O
the O
perfect O
memoir O
for O
your O
parents O
, O
family O
, O
siblings O
, O
and O
any O
other O
person O
important O
in O
your O
life O
that O
there O
may O
be O
. O

his O
language O
was O
so O
bad O
i O
swore O
i O
was O
taking O
the O
turing O
test O
, O
and O
it O
was O
failing O
. O

after O
replacing O
the O
hard B
drive B
the O
battery B
stopped O
working O
<number> O
months O
of O
use O
which O
was O
frustrating O
. O

was O
this O
product O
worth O
my O
time O
and O
money O
to O
ever O
want O
to O
purchase O
another O
products O
that O
is O
toshiba O
or O
relating O
to O
toshiba O
? O
probably O
not O
ever O
again O
. O

i O
have O
used O
pc's O
and O
converting O
to O
this O
macbook O
pro O
was O
easy O
. O

i O
love O
the O
easy O
to O
see O
screen B
, O
and O
it O
works B
well O
for O
work O
, O
persoal O
or O
just O
play O
. O

if O
what O
you O
need O
is O
a O
machine O
to O
do O
some O
surfing B
, O
email O
checking O
, O
word B
processing B
, O
and O
watching O
a O
movie O
or O
two O
, O
this O
is O
the O
machine O
you O
want O
. O

apparently O
, O
contactus O
euro O
. O
apple O
. O
com O
is O
not O
a O
good O
address O
to O
send O
complaints O
. O

it O
doesn't O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
frills O
, O
but O
i O
didn't O
need O
any O
, O
and O
being O
able O
to O
buy O
what O
i O
needed O
, O
and O
not O
more O
than O
i O
needed O
was O
very O
important O
. O

the O
mouse B
pad B
and O
buttons B
are O
the O
worst O
i've O
ever O
seen O
. O

i O
am O
sorry O
that O
i O
purchased O
this O
laptop O
. O

awesome O
graphics B
! O

it O
really O
is O
perfect O
for O
work B
and O
play B
. O

the O
pro O
is O
a O
great O
product O
, O
i B
wish O
that O
the O
<number> O
inch O
models O
came O
with O
the O
intel O
i B
processors B
and O
had O
a O
more O
comfortable O
edge B
the O
edges B
hurt O
my O
wrists O
. O

i O
am O
a O
college O
student O
and O
it O
has O
been O
very O
useful O
. O

the O
apple O
macbook O
is O
the O
best O
investment O
that O
i O
have O
ever O
made O
. O

my O
sister O
is O
the O
electronics O
manager O
at O
wal O
mart O
and O
she O
says O
that O
hp O
is O
the O
best O
. O

one O
drawback O
i O
noticed O
was O
sound B
quality B
via B
usb O
. O

the O
battery B
life B
sucked O
the O
juice O
from O
my O
laptop O
and O
when O
the O
extended B
life B
battery B
went O
out O
we O
were O
sol O
there O
to O
, O
so O
much O
for O
that O
warranty B
covering O
all O
the O
products O
we O
purchased O
. O

i O
needed O
a O
new O
computer O
for O
graduate O
school O
had O
never O
owned O
a O
laptop O
before O
, O
and O
the O
only O
reason O
i O
didn't O
purchase O
a O
mac O
was O
because O
my O
school's O
website O
strongly O
recommended O
students O
purchase O
pcs O
. O

i O
have O
had O
another O
mac O
, O
but O
it O
got O
slow O
due O
to O
an O
older O
operating B
system B
. O

if O
you O
have O
the O
money O
i O
suggest O
going O
for O
the O
i7 O
. O

that's O
very O
possible O
, O
but O
since O
they O
don't O
make O
windows O
xp O
drivers B
for O
the O
sound B
card B
in O
this O
machine O
, O
i O
was O
stuck O
until O
windows O
<number> O
came O
out O
. O

i'ts O
nice O
to O
have O
the O
higher O
end O
laptops O
, O
but O
this O
fits O
my O
budget B
and O
the O
features B
i O
need O
. O

it O
is O
, O
however O
, O
very O
heavy O
. O

was O
disappointed O
to O
find O
out O
that O
the O
model O
had O
been O
discontinued O
, O
apparently O
because O
of O
known O
motherboard B
problems O
. O

well O
, O
i O
started O
using O
google O
chrome O
, O
which O
is O
a O
little O
better O
, O
but O
it O
freezes O
too O
sometimes O
. O

also O
the O
speakers B
are O
not O
very O
loud O
, O
but O
it O
is O
a O
netbook O
. O

love O
this O
laptop O
wonderful O
price O
for O
what O
you O
get O
! O

but O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
they O
the O
company O
would O
not O
and O
could O
not O
do O
anything O
about O
my O
problem O
. O

just O
a O
black O
screen B
! O

all O
you O
have O
to O
do O
is O
turn O
it O
on O
and O
it O
works O
. O

a O
key O
contributor O
that O
led O
me O
to O
mac O
is O
the O
art B
aspect B
. O

eventually O
my O
battery B
wouldn't O
charge O
, O
so O
unless O
i O
had O
it O
plugged O
in O
it O
wouldn't O
even O
power O
on O
. O

recently O
there O
are O
a O
few O
incidents O
that O
annoy O
the O
hell O
out O
of O
me O
. O

save O
your O
money O
and O
go O
for O
a O
better O
device O
. O

i O
have O
been O
a O
pc O
user O
since O
middle O
school O
, O
but O
in O
my O
mid O
twenties O
i O
decided O
to O
convert O
to O
the O
dark O
side O
, O
or O
should O
i O
say O
the O
brighter O
side O
of O
life O
. O

purchased O
for O
development O
purposes O
, O
but O
it O
has O
turned O
into O
my O
everyday O
laptop O
as O
well O
for O
surfing B
, O
e O
mail O
, O
etc O
. O

without O
having O
to O
have O
extra O
equipment O
and O
or O
complicated O
routes O
to O
take O
to O
be O
able O
to O
do O
so O
. O

my O
first O
problem O
was O
with O
the O
pre O
loaded O
norton O
firewall O
security O
program B
. O

i O
had O
a O
usb O
connect B
but O
, O
i O
can't O
use O
it O
because O
it O
is O
not O
compatible O
. O

accordingly O
, O
i O
have O
decided O
to O
never O
purchase O
another O
hp O
product O
my O
five O
year O
old O
compaq O
lasted O
<number> O
years O
before O
the O
hard B
drive B
crashed O
. O

i O
ordered O
four O
d620 O
laptops O
. O

i O
know O
that O
everyone O
thinks O
macs O
are O
overpriced O
and O
overrated O
, O
but O
once O
you O
get O
past O
the O
initial O
expense B
you'll O
find O
that O
they're O
worth O
every O
penny O
besides O
, O
there's O
always O
the O
financing O
plan O
that O
best O
buy O
offers O
. O

i O
saw O
this O
one O
, O
and O
i O
have O
the O
most O
difficult O
time O
trying O
to O
use O
them O
, O
they've O
made O
great O
dust O
collectors O
, O
i O
hate O
putting O
this O
computer O
down O

i O
am O
not O
going O
to O
sit O
here O
and O
complain O
about O
it O
not O
having O
a O
cd B
drive B
and O
what O
not O
because O
it O
is O
a O
netbook O
, O
it O
is O
made O
to O
be O
compact O
and O
if O
you O
want O
all O
the O
other O
stuff O
get O
a O
laptop O
. O

i O
love O
the O
multi O
touch O
trackpad B
. O

i O
was O
psyched O
. O

i O
absolutely O
love O
my O
mac O
! O

from O
the O
second O
you O
open O
the O
box O
you O
will O
fall O
in O
love O
with O
this O
computer O
! O

hp O
is O
more O
interested O
in O
selling O
extended B
warranties B
which O
cost B
more O
than O
the O
netbook O
new O
then O
they O
are O
in O
helping O
or O
fixing O
. O

it O
would O
not O
let O
me O
connect O
to O
my O
wifi O
system O
where O
i O
lived O
. O

not O
too O
much O
junk O
software B
to O
remove O
. O

system O
is O
loosing O
about O
<number> O
of O
performance B
because O
of O
that O
. O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
use B
, O
good O
quality B
and O
good O
price B
. O

the O
difference O
in O
the O
apple O
keyboard B
from O
a O
pc's O
keyboard B
took O
a O
bit O
of O
tim O
to O
get O
used O
to O
, O
but O
overall O
it's O
worth O
it O
! O

it O
is O
also O
extremely O
pleasing O
to O
the O
eyes O
without O
looking O
too O
much O
like O
an O
alienware O
gaming O
machine O
. O

the O
extended B
warranty B
for O
the O
<number> O
and O
up O
computers O
was O
the O
only O
one O
available O
for O
purchase O
on O
the O
drop O
drown O
menu O
. O

only O
issue O
is O
that O
it O
is O
a O
little O
slow O
, O
and O
i'm O
fixing O
that O
by O
adding O
more O
ram O
. O

it O
is O
easily O
portable O
and O
i O
take O
it O
everywhere O
i O
go O
and O
might O
require O
internet O
access O
. O

if O
i O
have O
a O
few O
hundred O
dollars O
to O
spare O
, O
i'd O
buy O
the O
pro O
line O
though O
, O
the O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
and O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
ghz O
model O
. O

the O
hard B
drive B
crashed O
as O
well O
, O
and O
i O
had O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
power B
cord B
. O

but O
enough O
about O
that O
, O
i O
am O
an O
apple O
convert O
for O
life O
. O

i O
love O
it O
and O
will O
probably O
get O
another O
one O
when O
this O
goes O
to O
the O
laptop O
in O
the O
sky O
! O
! O

but O
, O
mac O
makes O
the O
switch O
from O
pc O
to O
mac O
easy O
. O

another O
issue O
i O
have O
with O
it O
is O
the O
battery B
. O

help O
, O
help O
, O
other O
than O
that O
gets O
a O
great O
little O
wonder O
. O

now O
i O
know O
! O

after O
<number> O
months O
of O
complaints O
, O
asus O
finally O
sent O
the O
right O
power B
supply B
to O
my O
techies B
. O

even O
set O
at O
the O
highest O
level O
, O
the O
computer O
sacrifices O
its O
queen O
every O
time O
. O

that O
included O
the O
extra O
sony O
sonic O
stage O
software B
, O
the O
speakers B
and O
the O
subwoofer B
i O
got O
that O
was O
worth O
the O
money O
, O
the O
bluetooth B
mouse B
for O
my O
supposedly O
bluetooth B
enabled B
computer O
, O
the O
extended B
life B
battery B
and O
the O
docking O
port B
. O

my O
macbook O
pro O
works B
like O
a O
dream O
, O
it O
has O
never O
overheated O
, O
or O
even O
been O
slightly O
warm O
for O
that O
matter O
. O

pc O
users O
use O
the O
powerpoint O
program B
for O
slide O
show O
presentation O
and O
mac O
users O
utilize O
keynote O
. O

i O
can't O
begin O
to O
say O
how O
disappointed O
i O
am O
. O

i O
get O
a O
ton O
of O
compliments O
on O
its O
size B
, O
and O
speaking O
as O
someone O
who O
regularly O
commutes O
on O
a O
bus O
, O
i O
can O
attest O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
is O
the O
perfect O
size B
computer O
if O
you're O
restricted O
to O
the O
width O
of O
your O
body O
for O
computing O
room O
. O

it O
takes O
me O
approximately O
<number> O
tries O
to O
get O
to O
each O
site O
, O
then O
after O
closing O
the O
browser B
and O
reopening O
it O
it O
actually O
works O
. O

easy O
to O
carry B
, O
can O
be O
taken O
anywhere O
, O
can O
be O
hooked O
up O
to O
printers O
, O
headsets O
. O

also O
the O
keyboard B
does O
not O
liht O
up O
so O
unless O
your O
sitting O
in O
a O
room O
with O
some O
light O
you O
cant O
see O
anything O
and O
thats O
bad O
for O
me O
because O
my O
boyfriend O
tends O
to O
watch O
tv O
in O
the O
dark O
at O
night O
which O
leaves O
me O
with O
no O
way O
of O
seeing O
the O
keyboard B
. O

take O
the O
simple O
, O
easy O
solution O
to O
your O
computer O
problems O
and O
stop O
waiting O
and O
smacking O
your O
old O
computer O
around O
. O

it O
is O
as O
good O
as O
new O
. O

and O
it O
didn't O
show O
up O
on O
the O
reciept O
, O
i O
don't O
know O
how O
we O
ordered O
it O
online O
! O

i O
went O
from O
bestbuy O
to O
dell O
, O
windows O
to O
apple O
. O

back O
then O
my O
entire O
family O
was O
devoted O
to O
the O
sony O
name O
. O

when O
i O
got O
my O
laptop O
back O
after O
this O
first O
instance O
it O
worked O
okay O
for O
a O
little O
bit O
then O
i O
started O
expeirencing O
issues O
again O
, O
everything O
from O
programs B
and O
drivers B
failing O
again O
, O
to O
it O
powering O
off O
for O
no O
reason O
, O
to O
locking O
up O
and O
freezing O
and O
just O
all O
sorts O
of O
issues O
. O

love O
that O
it O
doesn't O
take O
up O
space B
like O
a O
regular O
computer O
. O

<number> O
weeks O
after O
giving O
the O
computer O
for O
repair O
visited O
machouse O
amsterdam O
. O

they O
don't O
seem O
to O
be O
susceptible O
to O
viruses O
, O
which O
is O
one O
less O
big O
thing O
to O
worry O
about O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
computers O
. O

i O
was O
very O
excited O
because O
this O
was O
my O
first O
personal O
computer O
and O
i O
was O
purchasing O
it O
with O
my O
own O
money O
i O
had O
recieved O
from O
graduation O
presents O
. O

asked O
the O
customer B
service B
rep B
. O

so O
, O
i O
took O
it O
back O
to O
the O
apple O
store O
and O
they O
narcissist O
genius B
bar B
staff B
fixed O
it O
by O
resetting O
the O
fan B
at O
boot B
up B
. O

i O
cannot O
even O
imaging O
going O
back O
to O
a O
pc O
after O
using O
this O
wonderful O
computer O
. O

basic O
computer O
. O

i O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
the O
hp O
pavillion O
and O
that O
was O
my O
replacement O
and O
now O
i O
could O
not O
imagine O
going O
back O
to O
an O
acer O
at O
all O
. O

it O
turns O
out O
that O
this O
hp O
pc O
had O
been O
preciously O
sold O
by O
wal O
mart O
. O

i O
would O
totally O
recommend O
any O
other O
laptop O
over O
this O
pile O
of O
grabage O
. O

i O
managed O
to O
comply O
with O
these O
too O
and O
now O
have O
to O
wait O
and O
see O
if O
they O
can O
find O
another O
way O
to O
screw O
me O
. O

i O
should O
have O
bought O
one O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
. O

i O
looked O
at O
the O
computer O
and O
it O
said O
updating O
but O
the O
asked O
for O
a O
product O
key O
. O

i O
got O
what O
i O
paid O
for O
. O

just O
keep O
in O
mind O
the O
graphics B
is O
not O
dedicated O
so O
loading O
the O
movie O
almost O
took O
a O
minute O
, O
but O
it O
ran O
fairly O
smooth O
for O
a O
non O
dedicated O
graphics B
card B
. O

needs O
power O
and O
mouse B
cable O
to O
plug O
in O
back O
instead O
of O
side O
, O
in O
the O
way O
of O
operating O
a O
mouse B
in O
small O
area O
. O

however O
i O
dealt O
with O
this O
problem O
for O
over O
a O
year O
and O
it O
was O
more O
of O
a O
hastle O
then O
i O
have O
ever O
had O
with O
anything O
. O

i O
got O
the O
first O
blue O
screen O
of O
death O
in O
the O
early O
part O
of O
july O
. O

<number> O
ram O

, O
16gb O
ram O
support B
no O
wireless O
issues O
, O
at O
least O
for O
me O
. O

i O
agree O
with O
the O
previous O
comment O
that O
asus O
tech O
support O
is O
horrible O
which O
is O
a O
con O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

in O
fact O
, O
somehow O
and O
i O
never O
opened O
it O
up O
some O
specks O
of O
dust O
or O
something O
got O
inside O
the O
screen B
and O
are O
now O
there O
permanently O
, O
behind O
the O
front O
of O
the O
screen B
, O
in O
the O
way O
of O
the O
display B
. O

it O
seems O
to O
be O
incompatible O
with O
everything O
else O
. O

the B
mouse B
on B
the B
pad B
, O
the B
left B
button B
always O
sticks O
. O

when O
i O
took O
it O
back O
to O
best O
buy O
i O
asked O
them O
if O
they O
were O
seriously O
trying O
to O
drive O
me O
insane O
! O

i O
have O
tried O
to O
charge O
on O
different O
batteries B
with O
no O
luck O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
this O
computer O
to O
anyone O
searching O
for O
the O
perfect O
laptop O
, O
and O
the O
battery B
life B
is O
amazing O
. O

we O
use O
the O
built B
in B
tools B
often O
, O
itunes O
is O
open O
nearly O
every O
day O
and O
works O
great O
with O
my O
iphone O
. O

but O
my O
blog O
is O
read O
by O
my O
friends O
and O
search O
engine O
visitors O
. O

it O
was O
returned O
on O
the O
third O
day O
i O
owned O
it O
. O

it O
want O
take O
it O
, O
it O
keep O
saying O
error O
. O

anyone O
who O
is O
considering O
buying O
an O
acer O
computer O
of O
any O
sort O
, O
i O
seriously O
suggest O
you O
look O
into O
buying O
a O
different O
brand O
. O

the O
size B
of O
has O
actually O
help O
me O
out O
quite O
a O
bit O
by O
me O
being O
able O
to O
fit O
it O
in O
an O
already O
full O
backpack O
and O
to O
use O
it O
at O
a O
resturant O
where O
the O
food O
on O
the O
table O
is O
always O
so O
space O
consuming O
. O

highly O
recommend O
for O
daily O
use O
. O

we O
are O
addicted O
to O
the O
mac O
. O

because O
it O
is O
a O
defective O
product O
. O

second O
, O
it O
gets O
scratches O
easily O
and O
when O
it O
gets O
old O
some O
thing O
may O
operated O

true O
quality B
at O
a O
great O
price B
! O

not O
easy O
to O
carry B
. O

the O
programs B
that O
come O
standard O
with O
the O
leopard O
running B
system B
are O
enough O
for O
the O
average O
person O
to O
run O
all O
the O
basics O
. O

i O
am O
really O
heartbroken O
to O
have O
to O
post O
a O
terrible O
review O
. O

so O
what O
am O
i O
supposed O
to O
do O
? O
the O
lg O
service B
center B
cannot O
provide O
me O
the O
service B
when O
it O
is O
called O
the O
service B
center B
. O

the O
material O
this O
pro O
is O
made O
out O
of O
seems O
a O
lot O
nicer O
than O
any O
pc O
specs O
like O
i O
said O
this O
performs B
a O
lot O
better O
than O
any O
computer O
i've O
had O
in O
the O
past O
. O

it O
has O
been O
nothing O
but O
trouble O
from O
the O
time O
we O
bought O
it O
. O

after O
doing O
extensive O
research O
, O
macconnection O
had O
the O
lowest O
price B
on O
the O
<number> O
mbp O
i5 O
. O

i O
am O
addicted O
to O
photo B
booth B
! O

the O
operating B
system B
and O
user B
interface B
is O
very O
intuitive O
, O
and O
the O
large O
multi O
touch O
track B
pad B
is O
amazing O
. O

so O
, O
i O
went O
back O
. O

i O
like O
it O
so O
much O
, O
i O
bought O
another O
just O
for O
my O
wife O
. O

i O
took O
it O
back O
to O
the O
store O
and O
exchanged O
it O
for O
another O
one O
. O

all O
in O
all O
great O
item O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

hard B
disk B
the O
new O
editions O
gives O
you O
more O
hard B
disk B
space B
500gb O
instead O
of O
320gb O
but O
time O
has O
taught O
me O
never O
to O
trust O
an O

. O

this O

only O
wish O
it O

which O
apple O
doesn't O
support O
! O

it O
is O
extremely O
portable O
and O
easily O
connects B
to B
wifi O
at O
the O
library O
and O
elsewhere O
. O

i O
don't O
have O
that O
additional O
money O
right O
now O
, O
and O
therefore O
wouldn't O
have O
purchased O
it O
at O
this O
time O
. O

first O
things O
first O
, O
macbook O
pro O
has O
many O
applications B
to O
make O
life O
easier O
, O
unlike O
the O
windows B
computers O
. O

and O
the O
screen B
on O
this O
thing O
is O
absolutely O
amazing O
for O
high O
quality O
videos O
and O
movies O
and O
gaming B
. O

fast O
, O
fast O
and O
fast O
, O
the O
web O
pages O
just O
fly O
by O
. O

i O
considered O
i O
may O
have O
too O
much O
on O
the O
computer O
, O
but O
after O
looking O
, O
there O
was O
plenty O
of O
space B
and O
that O
is O
not O
the O
issue O
. O

i O
don't O
use O
my O
laptop O
in O
a O
way O
though O
that O
needs O
a O
long O
battery B
life B
so O
it's O
perfect O
for O
me O
. O

guess O
i'll O
stay O
away O
from O
hp O
. O

it O
is O
made O
better O
, O
thicker O
, O
and O
all O
out O
tough O
! O

it O
was O
about O
six O
months O
later O
when O
the O
overheating O
problem O
started O
again O
, O
to O
the O
point O
it O
felt O
like O
fire O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
machine O
! O

there O
is O
a O
blank O
lighted O
screen O
when O
i O
start O
and O
that O
is O
all O
. O

and O
i O
would O
recommend O
this O
to O
anypne O
looking O
for O
a O
new O
laptop O
. O

but O
then O
, O
something O
goes O
wrong O
. O

so O
far O
so O
good O
with O
this O
laptop O
. O

i O
must O
keep O
it O
plugged O
in O
at O
all O
times O
because O
it O
will O
not O
keep O
a O
charge B
for O
longer O
than O
four O
minutes O
. O

avoid O
this O
model O
. O

summary O
i've O
had O
this O
laptop O
for O
<number> O
months O
, O
out O
of O
the O
blue O
the O
power B
adapter B
stops O
working O
. O

i O
saw O
walmart O
had O
the O
same O
computer O
for O
about O
<number> O
but O
still O
knowing O
what O
i O
know O
now O
, O
i O
would O
not O
buy O
it O
at O
that O
price B
. O

the O
local O
computer O
repair O
shops O
send O
out O
ads O
that O
say O
along O
the O
lines O
of O
we O
can O
fix O
almost O
any O
problem O
or O
computer O
usually O
even O
the O
trouble O
some O
toshiba O
satellite O
. O

it O
has O
had O
some O
problems O
. O

theres O
always O
something O
wrong O
with O
it O
, O
wether O
it O
be O
some O
virus O
you O
can't O
track O
down O
, O
or O
it O
overheats O
, O
sometimes O
even O
catches O
on O
fire O
, O
you O
just O
can't O
use O
it O
. O

this O
computer O
is O
good O
for O
<number> O
days O
then O
it O
sucks O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
your O
life O
. O

of O
course O
, O
for O
a O
student O
, O
weight B
is O
always O
an O
issue O
. O

now O
mainboard B
is O
broken O
, O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
new O
one O
. O

the O
speed B
difference O
is O
next O
to O
nothing O
for O
a O
mac O
, O
and O
the O
hard B
drive B
can O
be O
manually O
upgraded O
or O
you O
could O
just O
buy O
a O
<number> O
500gb B
external B
hard B
drive B
. O

<number> O
. O
the O
wireless B
card B
is O
low O
quality O
. O

this O
little O
netboook O
is O
helping O
me O
get O
work O
done O
! O

they O
also O
use O
two O
totally O
different O
operating B
systems B
. O

they O
are O
about O
the O
same O
size O
keys B
. O

i'm O
definitely O
not O
hard O
on O
laptops O
and O
guarantee O
<number> O
that O
no O
liquid O
has O
touched O
this O
machine O
in O
my O
presence O
. O

i O
waited O
another O
month O
for O
approval O
and O
for O
them O
to O
build O
me O
a O
new O
laptop O
. O

this O
ain't O
it O
. O

i O
wasn't O
really O
as O
concerned O
about O
portability B
it's O
a O
very O
large O
laptop O
but O
it's O
not O
hard O
to O
move O
around O
or O
take O
on O
a O
trip O
which O
was O
a O
pleasant O
surprise O
. O

the O
people O
are O
frustrating O
to O
work O
with O
, O
the O
product O
itself O
is O
very O
cheaply O
made O
, O
and O
the O
accessories B
are O
less O
than O
satisfactory O
. O

they O
offer O
the O
best O
warranty B
in O
the O
business O
, O
and O
don't O
3rd O
party O
it O
out O
like O
toshiba O
. O

maybe O
three O
or O
four O
months O
ago O
it O
started O
blinking O
all O
of O
the O
sudden O
. O

the O
only O
problems O
are O
the O
sound B
isnt O
very O
loud O
i O
have O
to O
wear O
headphones O
. O

again O
windows B
based O
machines O
were O
not O
giving O
me O
anything O
to O
work O
with O
! O

finally O
, O
i O
couldn't O
take O
it O
anymore O
and O
ordered O
my O
apple O
. O

i O
should O
have O
kept O
my O
big O
, O
old O
hp O
. O

everything O
about O
a O
mac O
is O
wonderful O
, O
it O
takes O
a O
little O
used O
to O
learning O
and O
getting O
used O
to O
the O
new O
system B
, O
but O
you O
will O
learn O
fast O
and O
its O
all O
worth O
it O
. O

i O
love O
the O
size B
of O
the O
computer O
since O
i O
play O
games B
on O
it O
. O

i O
am O
a O
wife O
, O
mom O
and O
a O
school O
teacher O
and O
a O
college O
student O
. O

you O
know O
, O
using O
the O
computer O
should O
be O
fun O
, O
not O
aggrevation O
, O
especially O
when O
you O
are O
playing B
games B
or O
working O
with O
photos O
. O

you O
just O
get O
a O
trial O
version O
either O
way O
. O

i'm O
all O
for O
saving O
money O
but O
dell O
needs O
to O
step O
it O
up O
. O

there O
are O
no O
viruses O
or O
spyware O
to O
worry O
about O
like O
on O
a O
windows O
computer O
. O

great O
machine O
if O
you O
want O
to O
drop O
the O
cash O
for O
one O
. O

to O
be O
honest O
i O
think O
it O
was O
faulty O
equipment B
or O
something O
but O
idk O
. O

i O
also O
love O
the O
small O
, O
convenient O
size B
of O
my O
laptop O
, O
making O
it O
a O
perfect O
tool O
for O
my O
academic O
studies O
. O

i O
never O
have O
had O
a O
good O
result O
with O
this O
computer O
. O

i O
love O
its O
solid O
build B
, O
light O
wt B
and O
excellent O
battery B
life B
for O
now O
. O

you O
pay O
for O
what O
you O
get O
for O
. O

while O
about O
<number> O
years O
ago O
, O
i O
hope O
that O
the O
quality B
has O
changed O
. O

no O
more O
lenovo O
for O
me O
. O

i O
also O
bought O
one O
for O
my O
wife O
, O
and O
<number> O
for O
my O
office O
. O

however O
, O
a O
netbook O
will O
be O
a O
different O
story O
. O

i'm O
glad O
i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
, O
it O
was O
worth O
the O
few O
<number> O
extra O
dollars O
. O

the O
difference O
is O
it's O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
fun O
using O
the O
laptop O
now O
, O
still O
learning O
the O
apple O
navigation B
, O
but O
is O
fun O
and O
comes O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
cool O
apps B
. O

i O
am O
a O
full O
mac O
convert O
now O
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
that O
you O
buy O
this O
product O
. O

though O
you O
get O
a O
polite O
person O
, O
you O
often O
don O
t O
get O
a O
solution O
. O

i O
propose O
that O
i O
can O
just O
swap O
the O
hard B
drives B
. O

it O
was O
old O
but O
it O
was O
not O
till O
we O
bought O
the O
dell O
did O
we O
realize O
how O
great O
it O
was O
. O

the O
battery B
holds O
up O
well O
, O
it's O
built B
very O
solidly O
, O
and O
runs B
fast O
. O

sound O
card B
is O
limited O
though O
. O

i O
initially O
purchased O
my O
macbook O
pro O
<number> O
in O
april O
, O
and O
i O
loved O
it O
. O

this O
is O
a O
nicely O
sized B
laptop O
with O
lots O
of O
processing B
power B
and O
long O
battery B
life B
. O

after O
much O
battling O
with O
hp O
i O
was O
able O
to O
return O
it O
<number> O
times O
for O
repairs O
. O

so O
, O
you O
can O
imagine O
how O
unhappy O
i O
am O
with O
this O
item O
. O

but O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
, O
the O
mac O
book O
pro O
is O
so O
professional O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
can O
imagine O
is O
that O
sony O
jumped O
on O
early O
specifications O
for O
vista O
requirements O
from O
microsoft O
and O
designed O
it O
to O
those O
inadequate O
requirements O
. O

go O
for O
it O
! O

i O
highly O
recommend O
this O
computer O
for O
students O
looking O
for O
a O
solid O
machine O
to O
get O
them O
through O
college O
. O

the O
keyboard B
, O
which O
generally O
felt O
okay O
even O
for O
someone O
used O
to O
a O
desktop B
keyboard B
, O
now O
looks O
terrible O
. O

the O
display B
is O
awesome O
. O

after O
years O
of O
occasionally O
pulling O
my O
hair O
out O
fighting O
computer O
viruses O
, O
a O
good O
friend O
convinced O
me O
it O
was O
time O
to O
go O
the O
apple O
route O
. O

the O
mouse B
is O
a O
little O
bit O
different O
than O
what O
you're O
used O
to O
though O
it O
has O
one O
big O
flat O
panel O
and O
one O
full O
bar O
instead O
of O
two O
separate O
ones O
to O
click O
with O
but O
you O
get O
used O
to O
it O
quite O
quickly O
. O

it O
took O
several O
weeks O
just O
to O
get O
them O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
i O
owned O
the O
warranty B
. O

however O
, O
this O
laptop O
has O
a O
fatal O
flaw O
that O
i O
discovered O
merely O
a O
week O
after O
buying O
it O
. O

perfect O
trifecta O
! O

the O
keyboard B
is O
like O
no O
other O
laptop O
keyboard B
. O

it O
was O
a O
huge O
monstrosity O
of O
a O
laptop O
! O

computer O
crashed O
frequently O
and O
battery B
life B
decreased O
very O
quickly O
. O

i O
propose O
that O
they O
can O
just O
swap O
the O
hard B
drives B
. O

so O
don't O
get O
it O
. O

it O
was O
a O
tough O
choice O
. O

every O
driver B
on O
the O
drivers O
applications O
dvd O
is O
everything O
you O
will O
need O
for O
a O
reload O
. O

they O
sent O
it O
off O
and O
within O
<number> O
weeks O
i O
had O
it O
back O
good O
as O
new O
. O

the O
awesomest O
of O
the O
awesomest O
. O

one O
, O
owning O
a O
mac O
is O
essentially O
a O
full O
production O
studio O
in O
the O
case O
of O
a O
mac O
book O
a O
portable O
version O
. O

i O
would O
like O
to O
tell O
you O
about O
the O
best O
laptop O
i O
just O
got O
from O
mac O
. O

i'm O
glad O
it O
waited O
, O
this O
one O
is O
great O
. O

i O
called O
their O
repair B
depot B
as O
was O
told O
they O
would O
send O
me O
a O
new O
box O
to O
return O
the O
computer O
to O
the O
repair B
depot B
. O

for O
those O
old O
enough O
to O
remember O
, O
it O
is O
similar O
to O
beta O
versus O
vhs O
. O

it's O
also O
fairly O
easy O
to O
use O
the O
operating O
system O
. O

but O
, O
i O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
. O

i O
know O
that O
asus O
is O
known O
for O
making O
motherboards B
, O
but O
this O
is O
the O
worst O
computer O
experience O
that O
i O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

if O
so O
, O
you O
may O
be O
having O
similar O
problems O
. O

some O
days O
it's O
just O
blurry O
, O
some O
days O
it O
appears O
that O
it's O
raining O
on O
my O
nice O
desktop O
background O
of O
a O
lake O
and O
mountains O
. O

this O
is O
a O
great O
machine O
! O

this O
is O
my O
first O
personal O
satellite O
purchase O
but O
had O
very O
good O
experience O
through O
previous O
satellite O
work O
issued O
laptops O
. O

we O
figure O
that O
after O
everything O
his O
pc O
actually O
ended O
up O
costing B
<number> O
more O
than O
my O
original O
mac O
. O

so O
having O
the O
ac O
plug B
go O
out O
on O
me O
and O
get O
lose O
or O
i O
could O
actually O
here O
it O
inside O
my O
computer O
on O
two O
of O
the O
three O
times O
is O
not O
good O
. O

peformance O
is O
good O
for O
the O
price B
. O

the O
computer O
is O
currently O
in O
west O
verginia O
doe O
to O
the O
method O
of O
shipping B
choosen O
by O
toshiba O
. O

i O
can O
see O
why O
the O
have O
soooo O
much O
money O
. O

i'm O
really O
frustrated O
by O
this O
experience O
. O

and O
toshiba O
is O
totally O
unconcerned O
. O

summary O
hp O
knew O
they O
were O
shipping O
out O
bad O
bios O
and O
did O
nothing O
proactive O
to O
resolve O
it O
. O

and O
in O
<number> O
months O
, O
there O
have O
been O
no O
freezing O
up O
and O
no O
blue O
, O
purple O
, O
black O
or O
any O
other O
type O
of O
screen O
. O

i O
had O
<number> O
months O
when O
the O
ports B
started O
going O
out O
. O

think O
i O
would O
spend O
little O
extra O
to O
get O
a O
better O
made O
laptop O
. O

the O
improvements O
to O
the O
os O
have O
been O
relatively O
gradual O
, O
but O
substantive O
. O

i'll O
wait O
and O
save O
up O
for O
a O
new O
one O
. O

this O
laptop O
does O
everything O
i O
need O
it O
to O
very O
well O
. O

they O
are O
not O
. O

it O
makes O
sorting O
out O
all O
those O
photos O
on O
my O
digital O
camera O
a O
breeze O
, O
and O
organizing O
them O
by O
place O
, O
time O
taken O
, O
or O
sending O
them O
to O
an O
online O
print O
shop O
, O
or O
uploading O
them O
to O
flickr O
or O
facebook O
etc O
, O
is O
not O
hard O
at O
all O
. O

its O
been O
a O
year O
and O
am O
still O
waiting O
to O
see O
what O
there O
going O
to O
do O
about O
my O
laptop O
. O

i O
bought O
it O
to O
use O
in O
college O
and O
it O
is O
perfect O
. O

it O
is O
super O
easy O
to O
use B
. O

many O
of O
my O
classmates O
computers O
hard B
drives B
crashed O
. O

ease O
of O
use B
is O
just O
one O
of O
the O
benefits O
i O
love O
about O
my O
mac O
. O

i O
wouldn't O
play O
a O
first O
person O
shooter O
with O
this O
, O
mind O
, O
but O
if O
you O
wanted O
to O
run O
ms O
office O
, O
email O
, O
chat O
, O
download O
a O
video O
, O
listen O
to O

from O
a O
certain O
fruit O
named O

and O
were O
looking O
for O
a O
highly O
portable O
yet O
powerful O
netbook O
to O
do O
that O
all O
in O
, O
i'd O
highly O
recommend O
checking O
this O
out O
. O

the O
<number> O
macbook O
pro O
just O
fits O
in O
my O
budget B
and O
with O
free O
shipping B
and O
no O
tax O
to O
ca O
this O
is O
the O
best O
price B
we O
can O
get O
for O
a O
great O
product O
. O

it O
took O
me O
a O
while O
top O
get O
away O
from O
the O
land O
of O
pcs O
, O
but O
now O
that O
i O
have O
, O
i O
can't O
see O
myself O
going O
back O
to O
it O
. O

they O
discovered O
the O
manufacturer's O
defect O
and O
sent O
it O
in O
for O
repair O

the O
sheer O
power B
and O

the O

buying O
one O

they O
will O
not O
let O
you O
down O

almost O
<number> O
years O
ago O
i O
bought O
what O
was O
then O
the O
current O
, O
up O
to O
date O
hp O
pavilion O
if O
i O
recall O
correctly O
, O
it O
was O
the O
dv O
<number> O
t O
. O

it's O
not O
a O
recommendation O
, O
it' O
a O
plea O
. O

in O
early O
may O
i O
got O
it O
back O
and O
this O
time O
i O
only O
had O
it O
back O
for O
<number> O
day O
before O
it O
had O
a O
new O
issue O
so O
it O
was O
sent O
back O
in O
for O
the O
6th O
time O
they O
expedited O
the O
repairs O
so O
i O
was O
only O
supposed O
to O
have O
to O
be O
without O
it O
for O
<number> O
days O
and O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
fixed O
, O
by O
a O
senior O
tech O
. O

some O
features B
arent O
friendly O
volume B
wheel B
, O
sound B
quality B
, O
etc O
. O

a O
cheaper O
price B
should O
not O
equal O
a O
cheap O
product O
. O

when O
i O
started O
worrying O
for O
not O
hearing O
anything O
from O
them O
, O
i O
tried O
to O
call O
. O

i O
think O
the O
manual B
is O
somewhere O
on O
the O
hard B
drive B
, O
but O
i O
rather O
have O
a O
hard B
copy O
. O

got O
another O
<number> O
, O
and O
same O
issue O
. O

thank O
you O
best O
buy O
for O
putting O
my O
computer O
together O
and O
installing O
my O
first O
software B
you O
guys O
were O
great O
too O
! O

they O
were O
able O
to O
set O
up O
with O
labtops O
themselves O
within O
a O
few O
minutes O
. O

i O
consider O
myself O
an O
average O
user O
and O
this O
computer O
serves O
my O
need O
. O

adjust O
the O
sensitivity B
since O
it's O
not O
that O
responsive O
to O
begin O
with O
. O

after O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
, O
my O
battery B
life B
began O
to O
diminish O
but O
was O
replaced O
for O
free O
due O
to O
a O
company O
wide O
recall O
of O
my O
particular O
battery B
. O

the O
system B
constantly O
overheats O
, O
the O
battery B
life B
is O
too O
short O
, O
the O
case B
is O
coming O
apart O
, O
and O
my O
core B
applications B
that O
i O
use O
every O
day O
in O
my O
work O
as O
a O
graphic O
artist O
run O
poorly O
. O

i O
would O
never O
buy O
a O
dell O
again O
. O

later O
it O
held O
zero O
charge B
and O
its O
replacement O
worked O
for O
less O
than O
three O
months O
. O

the O
company O
sent O
me O
a O
whole O
new O
cord B
overnight O
and O
apologized O
. O

it's O
even O
easy O
to B
hook B
up B
to B
other B
wireless B
networks B
. O

also O
, O
i O
have O
had O
alot O
of O
trouble O
with O
the O
shift B
key B
to O
go O
to O
other O
lines O
. O

the O
rep B
did O
not O
even O
answer O
my O
question O
, O
i O
had O
to O
ask O
him O
, O
if O
he O
understood O
what O
i O
ask O
or O
if O
he O
spoke O
english O
because O
he O
didn't O
even O
try O
to O
acknowledge O
my O
question O
. O

i O
am O
now O
frustrated O
that O
i O
still O
have O
to O
use O
my O
work O
issued O
windows O
laptop O
! O

it O
gives O
me O
the O
power B
and O
speed B
that O
i O
need O
to O
run O
all O
the O
programs B
i O
use O
to O
edit O
. O

ilife O
is O
easily O
compatible O
with O
microsoft O
office O
so O
you O
can O
send O
and O
receive O
files O
from O
a O
pc O
. O

they O
don't O
crash O
. O

as O
a O
computer O
science O
student O
in O
college O
, O
i O
find O
that O
the O
portability B
, O
longevity B
, O
and O
ease O
of O
use B
of O
this O
computer O
make O
me O
shockingly O
want O
to O
do O
homework O
more O
; O

this O
notebook O
restarts O
every O
time O
there O
is O
a O
new O
update O
, O
so O
if O
you O
don't O
save O
your O
files O
and O
information O
, O
everything O
will O
be O
lost O
. O

i O
love O
this O
little O
one O
. O

so O
not O
having O
my O
laptop O
was O
discouraging O
. O

i O
fine O
apple O
mc373ll O
a O
<number> O
. O
66ghz O
<number> O
macboook O
pro O
notebook O
meets O
all O
my O
needs O
for O
a O
laptop O
computer O
when O
on O
the O
go O
. O

again O
i O
sent O
it O
back O
and O
they O
replaced O
the O
motherboard B
and O
some O
fan B
inside O
. O

fully O
charged B
, O
the O
macbook O
pro O
can O
last O
about O
five O
hours O
unplugged O
. O

it O
was O
a O
hard O
decision O
for O
me O
since O
the O
macbook O
pro O
looked O
so O
appealing O
. O

1st O
hand O
experience O
is O
very O
important O
, O
especially O
for O
a O
new O
customer O
. O

i O
especially O
appreciate O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
has O
almost O
zero O
viruses O
and O
spyware O
problems O
! O

even O
though O
it O
is O
much O
more O
expensive O
than O
many O
pc O
laptops O
, O
it O
is O
worth O
the O
price B
. O

i O
know O
there O
are O
way O
better O
laptops O
out O
there O
for O
the O
same O
price B
, O
and O
why O
spend O
money O
on O
shit O
when O
you O
can O
go O
out O
and O
get O
yourself O
a O
perfectly O
decent O
laptop O
that O
doesnt O
suck O
total O
monkey O
balls O
. O

for O
me O
, O
keys B
were O
starting O
to O
get O
stuck O
and O
wouldn't O
type O
very O
well O
. O

i O
don't O
like O
this O
company O
nor O
the O
toshiba O
brand O
, O
and O
i'll O
never O
buy O
another O
one O
because O
i've O
put O
more O
into O
it O
then O
it O
is O
worth O
. O

can't O
reinstall O
with O
standard B
os B
cd B
because O
of O
proprietary B
hardware B
drivers B
. O

however O
, O
this O
will O
be O
my O
last O
as O
well O
. O

there O
is O
a O
small O
red O
circle O
next O
to O
it O
with O
a O
x O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
and O
when O
i O
click O
on O
it O
it O
says O
consider O
replacing O
your O
battery B
and O
it O
does O
not O
hold O
full O
charge B
. O

so O
? O
how O
can O
you O
solve O
it O
? O
c'mon O
, O
i O
just O
bought O
the O
netbook O
<number> O
weeks O
ago O
. O

the O
computer O
was O
two O
weeks O
late O
in O
delivery B
because O
hp O
forgot O
to O
complete O
the O
required O
import O
paperwork O
. O

if O
you're O
looking O
for O
a O
great O
laptop O
, O
you've O
found O
the O
best O
here O
. O

the O
first O
programm B
i O
switched O
on O
was O
a O
game O
for O
my O
children O
. O

i O
have O
been O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
performance B
of O
this O
laptop O
. O

i O
have O
had O
my O
macbook O
for O
almost O
<number> O
months O
and O
can O
honestly O
say O
that O
i O
will O
never O
buy O
another O
computer O
if O
it O
is O
not O
a O
mac O
. O

i've O
always O
owned O
a O
pc O
and O
decided O
to O
try O
a O
macbook O
to O
see O
what O
it's O
all O
about O
. O

on O
two O
occasions O
the O
computer O
s O
calendar O
told O
me O
it O
was O
<number> O
. O

i O
bought O
it O
for O
my O
mom O
and O
she O
reports O
that O
the O
battery B
life B
lasts O
all O
day O
for O
her O
, O
it's O
very O
lightweight O
, O
and O
the O
response B
for O
the O
computing O
she's O
doing O
internet O
focused B
activity B
mail O
, O
research O
, O
etc O
. O
is O
excellent O
; O

its O
very O
nice O
and O
once O
you O
learn O
the O
features B
you O
will O
be O
so O
happy O
to O
have O
such O
a O
sophisticated O
computer O
. O

overall O
, O
this O
is O
a O
wonderful O
computer O
and O
definitly O
worth O
the O
purchase O
! O

it O
came O
alot O
faster O
than O
i O
thought O
it O
would O
have O
which O
was O
really O
exciting O
. O

then O
to O
make O
matters O
worst O
, O
there O
is O
noone O
that O
they O
can O
transfer O
you O
to O
. O

it O
is O
sleek O
and O
lightweight O
and O
charges B
quickly O
when O
needed O
. O

also O
you O
may O
need O
to O
charge B
it O
once O
a O
day O
, O
if O
for O
medium O
use O
every O
thing O
fast O
and O
easy O
with O
mac O
the O
size B
and O
look B
is O
the O
most O
feature B
that O
attracted O
me O
to O
it O
. O

but O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
computer O
field O
you O
probably O
wouldn't O
be O
here O
. O

the O
great O
<number> O
month O
same O
as O
cash O
financing O
and O
advance O
protection O
plan O
which O
includes O
accidents O
like O
spills O
. O

i O
could O
not O
handle O
it O
one O
hand O
like O
i O
can O
the O
replacement O
computer O
i O
purchased O
. O

the O
new O
macbook O
pro O
<number> O
inch O
i7 O
is O
nothing O
short O
of O
amazing O
. O

i O
would O
never O
go O
back O
any O
more O
, O
i O
love O
this O
computer O
so O
much O
and O
i O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone O
. O

they O
respond O
your O
dissatisfaction O
is O
noted O
. O
. O
. O

i O
was O
even O
able O
to O
uninstall O
mcaffe O
and O
install O
one O
of O
my O
symantec O
licenses O
with O
a O
no O
issues O
whatsoever O
. O

the O
ibook O
backup B
also O
uses O
a O
firewire B
connection B
. O

i O
did O
think O
it O
had O
a O
camera B
because O
that O
was O
one O
of O
my O
requirements O
, O
but O
forgot O
to O
check O
in O
the O
specifications B
on O
this O
one O
before O
i O
purchased O
. O

also O
the O
display B
is O
exceptional O
! O

this O
is O
still O
a O
fairly O
good O
upgrade O
to O
a O
laptop O
that O
was O
about O
<number> O
years O
old O
. O

the O
computer O
was O
shipped O
to O
their O
repair B
depot B
on O
june O
<number> O
and O
returned O
on O
july O
<number> O
seems O
like O
a O
short O
turn O
around O
time O
except O
the O
computer O
was O
not O
repaired O
when O
it O
was O
returned O
. O

this O
is O
basically O
the O
best O
laptop O
i O
have O
ever O
had O
or O
used O
. O

3dmark6 O
score O
is O
only O
<number> O
. O

i O
tell O
everyone O
i O
see O
out O
looking O
to O
get O
this O
or O
another O
toshiba O
. O

so O
honestly O
, O
i O
wasn't O
expecting O
anything O
less O
than O
perfection O
, O
and O
i O
wasn't O
disappointed O
. O

learning O
all O
of O
the O
keyboard B
shortcuts B
only O
took O
a O
few O
minutes O
to O
get O
used O
to O
as O
some O
of O
the O
shortcuts B
are O
the O
same O
on O
windows O
machines O
. O

my O
friends O
are O
in O
awe O
every O
time O
they O
come O
over O
! O

little O
short O
on O
ram O
but O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

it O
didn't O
come O
with O
any O
software B
installed O
outside O
of O
windows B
media B
, O
but O
for O
the O
price B
, O
i O
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
condition O
and O
the O
overall O
product O
. O

the O
first O
one O
i O
had O
was O
a O
<number> O
model O
, O
not O
the O
pro O
. O

then O
, O
one O
month O
after O
the O
warranty B
expired O
, O
the O
replacement B
charger B
went O
. O

2nd O
mac O
book O
i O
have O
purchased O
from O
macconnection O
. O

i O
love O
a O
pc O
but O
i O
was O
ready O
for O
a O
change O
and O
tired O
of O
the O
windows B
system B
. O

your O
cursor B
will O
end O
up O
all O
over O
the O
freaking O
place O
, O
, O
, O
it's O
not O
uncommon O
for O
me O
to O
accidentally O
delete O
words O
, O
sentences O
, O
paragraphs O
because O
of O
this O
mousepad B
. O

other O
installed O
features B
, O
such O
as O
certain O
printer B
software B
, O
are O
also O
most O
attractive O
. O

i O
normally O
dont O
participate O
in O
reviews O
surveys O
but O
this O
laptop O
has O
not O
given O
me O
any O
problems O
and O
hope O
to O
share O
my O
thoughts O
. O
. O
. O

most O
of O
the O
large O
bags O
are O
for O
a O
<number> O
inch O
. O

i O
work O
in O
film O
editing O
and O
post O
production O
, O
so O
i O
need O
a O
laptop O
that O
not O
only O
has O
power B
, O
but O
memory B
and O
speed B
as O
well O
. O

i O
took O
it O
home O
and O
within O
<number> O
min O
, O
it O
was O
freezing O
up O
and O
did O
the O
blue O
screen O
of O
death O
. O

at O
first O
when O
i O
got O
this O
product O
, O
i O
loved O
it O
. O

i O
think O
this O
computer O
is O
super O
lame O
. O

it O
had O
a O
seventeen B
inch B
screen B
which O
i O
wanted O
, O
but O
i O
didn't O
realize O
at O
the O
time O
it O
would O
be O
such O
a O
monster O
! O

even O
doing O
so O
, O
the O
hinge B
may O
just O
be O
slightly O
tightened O
only O
. O

company O
provides O
ups O
shipping B
, O
fast O
, O
great O
! O

i O
would O
tell O
the O
technician B
i O
knew O
exactly O
what O
was O
wrong O
with O
it O
but O
they O
did O
not O
listen O
and O
i O
had O
to O
go O
through O
a O
bunch O
of O
junk O
to O
get O
them O
to O
tell O
me O
i O
needed O
to O
send O
the O
computer O
in O
. O

this O
is O
what O
a O
laptop O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
. O

then O
i've O
fixed O
the O
dc O
jack B
inside O
the O
unit O
, O
rewired O
the O
dc O
jack B
to O
the O
outside O
of O
the O
laptop O
, O
replaced O
the O
power B
brick B
. O

i O
purchased O
two O
laptops O
for O
my O
husband O
and O
<number> O
year O
old O
daughter O
. O

more O
relieved O
than O
anything O
. O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
use B
, O
has O
great O
screen B
quality B
, O
and O
every O
so O
light O
weight O
. O

great O
product O
, O
very O
easy O
to O
use B
and O
great O
graphics B
. O

summary O
spend O
your O
money O
elsewhere O

believe O
me O
apple O
has O
a O
reputation O
. O

the O
ilife O
software B
that O
comes O
with O
the O
computer O
is O
so O
simple O
to O
use B
and O
produces O
a O
great O
finished O
product O
. O

the O
built O
in O
webcam B
is O
great O
for O
skype O
and O
similar O
video O
chat O
services O
. O

the O
shop O
will O
definitely O
push O
the O

i O
am O
able O

easily O

while O
i O
mostly O
use O

internet B
and O
gaming B
, O
i'm O
confident O
all O
other O
applications B
live O
up O
to O
the O
high O
standard O
i've O
come O
to O
appreciate O
from O
mac O
laptops O
. O

i've O
been O
having O
endless O
problems O
since O
i O
bought O
the O
computer O
only O
<number> O
month O
ago O

the O
perfect O
notebook O
. O
. O
. O

this O
laptop O
looks O
great O
on O
the O
surface O
<number> O
inch B
screen B
, O
good O
price O
point O
, O
nice O
appearance B
, O
boots B
up B
quickly O
, O
runs B
fast O
etc O
. O

the O
apple O
systems O
are O
over O
priced O
luxurys O
that O
arn't O
worth O
what O
they O
are O
being O
charged O
for O
, O
this O
model's O
specifications B
are O
far O
from O
being O
impressive O
and O
they O
only O
thing O
you O
get O
out O
of O
this O
is O
the O
apple O
name O
. O

my O
mac O
laptop O
is O
fabulous O
in O
both O
areas O
. O

pros O
the O
macbook O
pro O
notebook O
has O
a O
large O
battery B
life B
and O
you O
wont O
have O
to O
worry O
to O
charge O
your O
laptop O
every O
five O
hours O
or O
so O
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
this O
product O
! O

disappointing O
for O
such O
a O
lovely O
screen B
and O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price B

so O
far O
, O
it's O
an O
average O
laptop O
no O
better O
, O
no O
worse O
than O
the O
hp O
i O
replaced O
. O

the O
only O
bad O
thing O
about O
it O
is O
they O
give O
you O
the O
worst O
batteries B
possible O
. O

good O
price B
. O

the O
motherboard O
is O
dead O
! O

i O
wanted O
to O
spend O
around O
<number> O
to O
<number> O
so O
i O
was O
directed O
to O
a O
nice O
looking O
hp O
laptop O
. O

the O
speed B
is O
fine O
. O

i O
was O
starting O
to O
boil O
. O

hmmm O
that O
high O
failure O
rate O
sure O
isn't O
reflected O
in O
the O
retail B
price B
. O

back O
she O
goes O
! O

it O
was O
not O
clear O
that O
the O
microsoft O
student O
edition O
that O
was O
loaded O
on O
the O
computer O
, O
was O
a O
six O
month O
trial O
. O

not O
the O
day O
received O
. O

good O
for O
every B
day B
computing B
and O
web B
browsing B
. O

while O
lacking O
some O
of O
the O
functions B
of O
the O
other O
versions O
, O
this O
was O
very O
acceptable O
for O
the O
uses O
planned O
for O
this O
computer O
. O

also O
, O
i O
have O
had O
alot O
of O
trouble O
with O
the O
keys B
sticking O
and O
will O
not O
type O
correctly O
. O

it O
still O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
little O
lose O
now O
but O
so O
far O
seems O
to O
be O
hanging O
in O
there O
. O

it O
is O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
investments O
i O
have O
ever O
made O
. O

if O
you O
are O
a O
pc O
user O
looking O
to O
convert O
i O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O
! O

excellent O
led O
monitor B
and O
well O
equipped O
. O

this O
process O
continued O
to O
repeat O
itself O
until O
the O
mother B
board B
had O
been O
replaced O
<number> O
times O
and O
the O
hard B
drive B
replaced O
<number> O
times O
. O

without O
a O
doubt O
, O
the O
design B
of O
this O
laptop O
is O
fantastic O
. O

i O
couldn't O
believe O
how O
long O
the O
battery B
lasted O
on O
a O
single O
charge B
. O

i O
could O
save O
ten O
essay O
papers O
and O
have O
hardly O
any O
memory B
left O
. O

i've O
had O
my O
macbook O
pro O
since O
august O
<number> O
. O

unfortunately O
, O
the O
laptop O
i O
purchased O
was O
also O
a O
dell O
and O
again O
, O
i O
have O
to O
say O
i O
hated O
it O
. O

took O
a O
while O
to O
clean O
it O
up O
to O
my O
specs O
. O

they O
are O
so O
realistic O
i O
am O
just O
speechless O
. O

other O
than O
that O
, O
i O
would O
recommend O
this O
to O
someone O
in O
need O
of O
a O
cheap O
laptop O
with O
semi O
decent O
gaming B
capabilities O
. O

this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
i O
tried O
and O
owning O
a O
netbook O
although O
i O
have O
used O
<number> O
different O
laptops O
in O
the O
past O
<number> O
years O
, O
i O
find O
not O
much O
difference O
except O
of O
course O
for O
the O
screen B
size B
. O

but O
the O
biggest O
pain O
is O
that O
tech B
support B
is O
not O
available O
<number> O
<number> O
. O

there O
are O
differences O
that O
you O
need O
to O
know O
and O
take O
time O
to O
learn O
. O

they O
have O
more O
problems O
then O
a O
1980's O
computer O
. O

it O
is O
amazing O
. O

needless O
to O
say O
, O
not O
to O
happy O
with O
the O
product O
. O

the O
cool O
thing O
about O
this O
is O
anyone O
can O
use O
it O
. O

my O
first O
laptop O
was O
an O
acer O
that O
i O
got O
for O
christmas O
. O

still O
, O
this O
laptop O
is O
perfect O
for O
all O
day O
use O
at O
school O
and O
work O
. O

the O
internet O
can O
be O
an O
scary O
place O
its O
up O
to O
you O
on O
what O
you O
do O
with O
it O
. O

the O
backlit B
keys B
are O
wonderful O
when O
you O
are O
working O
in O
the O
dark O
. O

i O
chose O
the O
ibookg4 O
, O
a O
laptop O
that O
is O
an O
attractive O
computer O
with O
a O
large O
screen B
big O
enough O
to O
please O
anyone O
. O

the O
most O
recent O
being O
that O
my O
safari O
internet B
browser B
is O
freaking O
out O
on O
me O
, O
but O
i O
have O
just O
been O
using O
firefox B
instead O
. O

i O
would O
say O
if O
you O
want O
to O
buy O
one O
of O
these O
machines O
be O
careful O
. O

everything O
about O
the O
mac O
is O
not O
only O
visually O
appealing O
, O
but O
very O
easy O
to O
use B
. O

i O
know O
what O
<number> O
hrs O
of O
battery B
looks O
like O
. O

the O
macbooks O
worth O
every O
penny O
. O

i O
did O
not O
have O
to O
call O
the O
support B
line B
at O
all O
. O

the O
laptop O
is O
outstanding O
in O
all O
aspects O
except O
that O
it O
has O
the O
windows O
<number> O
starter B
and O
not O
the O
full O
windows O
<number> O
. O

the O
first O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
keyboard O
function O
is O
simply O
unsatisfactory O
. O

the O
dvd O
drive B
randomly O
pops O
open O
when O
it O
is O
in O
my O
backpack O
as O
well O
, O
which O
is O
annoying O
. O

garageband O
is O
more O
for O
the O
musicians O
, O
and O
the O
laptop O
is O
equipped O
with O
a O
good O
working O
microphone B
, O
good O
enough O
for O
beginners O
and O
musicians O
at O
the O
intermediate O
level O
. O

i O
dual O
boot O
with O
linux O
and O
that O
other O
security O
prone O
os O
and O
it O
performs B
flawlessly O
. O

the O
difference O
is O
the O
toshiba O
had O
a O
lot O
more O
memory B
and O
hard B
drive B
space B
. O

but O
if O
you O
can't O
make O
your O
product O
last O
more O
than O
a O
year O
, O
you O
will O
not O
get O
my O
business O
again O
. O

there O
was O
a O
little O
difficulty O
doing O
the O
migration O
as O
the O
firewire B
cable B
system B
can't O
be O
used O
with O
the O
ibook O
. O

seems O
like O
maybe O
a O
bad O
shipment B
from O
toshiba O
. O

don't O
waste O
your O
money O
! O

currently O
if O
i O
use O
the O
laptop O
i O
can't O
sit O
it O
on O
my O
lap O
because O
it O
will O
burn O
my O
legs O
. O

managed O
to O
send O
complaint O
email O
. O

however O
, O
they O
were O
kind O
enough O
to O
send O
a O
replacement O
free O
of O
charge O
. O

seriously O
considering O
a O
larger O
laptop O
to O
replace O
the O
dell O

os O
x O
is O
solid O
with O
lots O
of O
innovations O
such O
as O
quicklook B
which O
save O
heaps O
of O
time O
. O

i O
do O
everything O
on O
this O
computer O
check O
email O
, O
facebook O
, O
shop O
, O
check O
blogs O
, O
write O
papers O
, O
listen O
to O
music O
, O
and O
we O
even O
watch O
all O
of O
our O
movies O
on O
it O
since O
we O
do O
not O
have O
a O
tv O
. O

i O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
simple O
job O
. O

but O
other O
than O
that O
i O
am O
blown O
away O
by O
all O
the O
features B
this O
laptop O
offers O
. O

i O
hate O
it O
! O

don't O
buy O
this O
model O
. O

the O
keyboard B
is O
slick O
and O
quiet O
and O
not O
bulky O
like O
some O
other O
laptops O
i O
have O
had O
in O
the O
past O
. O

i O
can O
leave O
my O
macbook O
uncharged O
for O
upwards O
of O
eight O
hours O
and O
it O
won't O
even O
be O
dead O
. O

overall O
, O
this O
laptop O
is O
definitely O
a O
keeper O
with O
its O
simple O
yet O
stylish O
design B
and O
its O
array O
of O
fantastic O
colors B
to O
choose O
from O
. O

i O
do O
find O
that O
my O
macbook O
has O
a O
lot O
more O
bells O
and O
whistles O
than O
a O
normal O
pc O
especially O
if O
you O
enjoy O
technology O
, O
downloading O
pictures O
and O
graphic O
design O
. O

first O
the O
screen B
goes O
completely O
out O
. O

i'm O
learning O
the O
finger O
options O
for O
the O
mousepad B
that O
allow O
for O
quicker O
browsing B
of O
web O
pages O
. O

i O
love O
this O
<number> O
mac O
white O
unibody O
. O

the O
last O
time O
we O
took O
it O
to O
get O
fixed O
the O
guy O
said O
that O
most O
likely O
it O
is O
a O
reppative O
problem O
and O
will O
keep O
happeneing O
so O
hopefully O
we O
can O
get O
a O
new O
one O
very O
soon O
! O

when O
i O
am O
at O
starbucks O
between O
clients O
i O
get O
full O
bars O
on O
my O
hp O
and O
<number> O
bar O
on O
my O
eee O
pc O
. O

the O
photobooth O
is O
a O
great O
program B
, O
it O
takes O
very O
good O
pictures O
with O
the O
built O
in O
camera B
. O

and O
inconvenient O
! O

many O
kinds O
of O
software B
that O
is O
necessary O
to O
the O
working O
person O
is O
not O
available O
and O
cannot O
be O
downloaded O
. O

it O
is O
so O
speedy O
. O

needs O
constant O
repair O
. O

i O
will O
never O
purchase O
a O
hp O
again O
ever O
. O

i O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
shipping B
! O

it O
bluescreened O
on O
me O
without O
any O
warning O
, O
running O
simply O
basic O
chrome O
. O

this O
is O
another O
reason O
to O
like O
the O
mac O
. O

i O
took O
<number> O
<number> O
years O
researching O
brands O
and O
prices B
of O
laptops O
. O

one O
bad O
thing O
is O
it O
gets O
hot O
. O

i'm O
stuck O
w O
a O
broken O
computer O
. O

we O
researched O
and O
found O
the O
best O
price B
at O
macconnection O
. O

hope O
this O
helps O
! O

but O
guess O
what O
? O
you O
have O
to O
buy O
an O
external B
dvd B
drive B
it O
doesn't O
have O
a O
built O
in O
type O
the O
notebook O
can't O
be O
used O
because O
it O
doesn't O
read O
anything O
for O
an O
external B
drive B
. O

get O
this O
computer O
for O
portability O
and O
fast O
processing O
! O
! O
! O

apparently O
they're O
not O
special O
anymore O
. O

i O
use O
a O
cooling B
pad B
but O
it O
doesn't O
help O
. O

i'm O
so O
glad O
i O
purchased O
a O
mac O
and O
not O
another O
pc O
! O
! O
! O

<number> O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

few O
viruses O
to O
catch O
; O

supplied O
software B
the O
software B
that O
comes O
with O
this O
machine O
is O
greatly O
welcomed O
compared O
to O
what O
windows O
comes O
with O
. O

steve O
jobs O
, O
probably O
needs O
help O
and O
donations O
, O
and O
cannot O
afford O
a O
reasonable O
offers O
for O
people O
that O
truly O
are O
trying O
to O
support O
his O
baby O
. O

i'm O
tired O
of O
the O
inept O
service B
. O

garageband O
is O
easy O
to O
work O
with O
, O
like O
all O
the O
other O
apple B
applications B
i've O
had O
experience O
with O
. O

no O
, O
tey O
don't O
even O
support O
their O
own O
bios B
and O
it O
could O
be O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
bios B
how O
can O
a O
company O
that O
makes O
a O
fairly O
decent O
product O
get O
away O
with O
such O
insanity O
? O
? O
! O
! O

while O
many O
people O
brag O
about O
mac O
being O
intuitive O
, O
it O
does O
take O
a O
little O
time O
to O
adjust O
to O
coming O
from O
a O
pc O
, O
but O
once O
i O
got O
the O
hang O
of O
it O
, O
i O
don't O
want O
to O
go O
back O
. O

because O
we O
did O
not O
purchase O
the O
extended B
warranty B
in O
time O
, O
we O
are O
on O
the O
hook O
for O
the O
repair O
. O

it O
started O
out O
by O
randomly O
ceasing O
to O
charge B
when O
it O
was O
plugged O
in O
mousing O
over O
the O
battery O
icon O
would O
read O
, O
for O
example O
, O
<number> O
, O
plugged O
in O
, O
not O
charging B

requiring O
me O
to O
unplug O
it O
and O
plug O
it O
back O
in O
several O
times O
to O
get O
it O
to O
charge B
. O

this O
laptop O
looked O
brand O
new O
and O
was O
shipped B
very O
quickly O
. O

if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
something O
reliable O
, O
this O
is O
the O
laptop O
for O
you O
. O

info O
windows O
failed O
to O
load O
because O
the O
kernal B
is O
missing O
, O
or O
corrupt O
. O

the O
display B
on O
this O
computer O
is O
the O
best O
i've O
seen O
in O
a O
very O
long O
time O
, O
the O
battery B
life B
is O
very O
long O
and O
very O
convienent O
. O

most O
laptops O
and O
notebooks O
are O
difficult O
to O
key O
on O
. O

we O
didn't O
because O
it O
was O
already O
over O
<number> O
, O
<number> O
dollars O
! O

but O
the O
quality B
, O
in O
general O
was O
less O
than O
the O
worth O
of O
the O
cheap O
laptop O
. O

in O
the O
first O
moth O
of O
owning O
this O
computer O
its O
hardrive B
failed O
which O
had O
to O
be O
replaced O
. O

its O
also O
fun O
to O
use B
! O

the O
graphics B
and O
screen B
are O
stunning O
and O
although O
i O
was O
a O
pc O
person O
, O
i O
was O
able O
to O
understand O
how O
to O
use O
a O
mac O
fairly O
quickly O
. O

with O
the O
upgraded B
memory B
, O
the O
macbook O
pro O
never O
has O
an O
issue O
running B
many O
many O
applications B
at O
once O
! O

simple O
to O
use B
, O
and O
great O
graphics B
. O

it O
still O
serves O
me O
well O
both O
in O
business O
and O
home O
needs O
. O

i O
use O
my O
friends O
and O
family's O
<number> O
laptops O
and O
they O
are O
fast O
and O
reliable O
and O
hp O
, O
well O
, O
i'll O
never O
buy O
or O
recommend O
an O
hp O
to O
anyone O
! O

my O
macbook O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
investment O
i O
have O
ever O
made O
. O

the O
internet B
speed B
is O
spectacular O
. O

they O
claim O
call B
center B
is O
still O
down O
. O

mac O
also O
has O
many O
apps B
and O
programs B
that O
are O
quite O
cheap O
or O
free O
. O

if O
you O
shop O
around O
in O
the O
current O
market O
you O
can O
find O
a O
much O
better O
deal O
. O

i O
droped O
this O
once O
from O
thetable O
when O
my O
baby O
girl O
grabed O
me O
one O
day O
and O
it O
is O
still O
working O
with O
no O
issues O
! O

you O
will O
love O
this O
macbook O
if O
you O
choose O
to O
buy O
it O
. O

my O
house O
is O
now O
<number> O
macbook O
. O

they're O
not O
safe O
, O
they're O
not O
durable O
, O
they O
just O
a O
worthless O
. O

my O
husband O
uses O
it O
mostly O
for O
games B
, O
email O
and O
music O
. O

i O
have O
had O
no O
luck O
with O
staples O
or O
hp O
to O
resolve O
this O
problem O
. O

i O
just O
took O
the O
broken O
cords B
into O
the O
apple O
store O
and O
they O
gave O
me O
new O
ones O
. O

my O
mac O
is O
much O
more O
efficient O
than O
a O
pc O
so O
it O
does O
not O
need O
the O
extra O
bells O
and O
whistles O
to O
compete O
. O

it O
works O
! O

you O
just O
lose O
a O
customer O
. O

i O
ve O
had O
several O
calls O
lasting O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
with O
promises O
to O
call O
back O
, O
but O
the O
return O
calls O
never O
came O
. O

apparently O
under O
the O
screen B
there O
are O
<number> O
little O
screws O
and O
when O
the O
screen B
gets O
moved O
back O
and O
forth O
, O
they O
come O
loose O
. O

being O
a O
pc O
user O
my O
whole O
life O
, O
it's O
taking O
a O
bit O
of O
time O
to O
adapt O
to O
the O
os O
of O
a O
mac O
but O
i'm O
finding O
my O
way O
around O
. O

the O
computer O
will O
constantly O
be O
getting O
hot O
and O
burning O
your O
leg O
unless O
you O
go O
through O
the O
hassle O
of O
taking O
off O
the O
entire O
back O
of O
it O
just O
to O
clean O
out O
the O
fan B
. O

i O
have O
in O
the O
past O
gotten O
superfine O
sandpaper O
and O
fixed O
the O
edges B
by O
rounding O
them O
off O
. O

i O
hate O
it O
! O

returned O
it O
. O

downfalls O
sharp O
edges B
. O

it O
is O
a O
cheap O
throw O
together O
. O

i O
needed O
one O
to O
be O
able O
to O
carry B
to O
work O
everyday O
and O
this O
one O
seems O
to O
fit O
all O
of O
the O
criteria O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
mac O
, O
and O
do O
, O
to O
anyone O
looking O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
computer O
. O

the O
screen B
is O
gorgeous O
yummy O
good O
. O

did O
i O
mention O
everything O
about O
it O
, O
from O
size B
to O
weight B
to O
keyboard B
screams O
bulk O
? O

can't O
wait O
until O
i O
go O
on O
vacation O
and O
take O
it O
with O
me O
. O

good O
bye O
blue O
screen O
and O
critical O
errors O
! O
! O
! O
! O

i O
had O
it O
four O
months O
when O
my O
disc B
drive B
refused O
to O
open O
. O

so O
, O
after O
apple O
replaced O
the O
hard B
drive B
i O
enjoyed O
another O
<number> O
months O
of O
my O
new O
computer O
, O
until O
it O
froze O
this O
morning O
completely O
. O

once O
again O
, O
i O
was O
told O
it O
was O
the O
suspicious O
power B
supply B
problem O
. O

it O
easily O
fits O
into O
most O
computer O
bags O
but O
doesn't O
weigh O
down O
a O
backpack O
or O
satchel O
when O
being O
carried O
with O
spirals O
and O
or O
textbooks O
. O

the O
macbook O
starts B
fast O
, O
doesn't O
crash O
, O
has O
a O
fantastic O
display B
, O
is O
small O
and O
light O
i O
have O
the O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
model O
, O
and O
isn't O
always O
complaining O
about O
updates O
, O
lost O
connections O
, O
errors O
, O
blue O
screens O
, O
etc O
. O

it O
was O
kind O
of O
a O
rebellion O
against O
pc O
in O
fact O
, O
and O
i O
am O
certainly O
glad O
i O
did O
. O

unable O
to O
boot B
up B
this O
brand O
new O
laptop O
. O

in O
addition O
, O
all O
the O
design O
tools O
on O
pages O
and O
keynotes O
makes O
it O
much O
easier O
to O
create O
professional O
looking O
documents O
and O
presentations O
. O

i O
actually O
had O
the O
hard B
drive B
replaced O
twice O
, O
the O
mother B
board B
once O
, O
the O
dvd B
drive B
twice O
, O
then O
they O
finally O
agreed O
to O
replace O
it O
, O
all O
of O
this O
in O
less O
than O
<number> O
<number> O
<number> O
years O
! O

i O
really O
don't O
like O
it O
, O
but O
i O
am O
stuck O
. O

the O
guy O
then O
said O
that O
if O
i O
insist O
on O
having O
the O
hinge B
tightened O
, O
they O
can O
do O
it O
for O
me O
but O
i O
have O
to O
accept O
the O
condition O
after O
the O
repair O
. O

the O
port B
is O
secured O
to O
motherboard B
so O
when O
this O
happens O
you O
can't O
see O
the O
plug B
at O
all O
, O
it's O
just O
gone O
. O

stay O
away O
from O
machouse O
amsterdam O
. O

once O
again O
apple O
stands O
alone O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
charts O
. O

i O
love O
the O
feel O
of O
the O
key B
board B
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
trackpad B
. O

now O
i O
have O
the O
best O
of O
both O
worlds O
with O
all O
of O
the O
power B
and O
ease B
of O
the O
mac O
! O

these O
new O
problems O
were O
the O
final O
straws O
; O

luckly O
i O
had O
a O
student O
task O
force O
able O
to O
help O
, O
or O
else O
it O
would O
have O
crashed O
within O
the O
first O
year O
. O

that O
seemed O
to O
solve O
the O
problem O
, O
till O
i O
wrote O
an O
article O
with O
semicolons O
in O
it O
. O

ease O
of O
use B
is O
just O
one O
of O
the O
benefits O
i O
love O
about O
my O
mac O
. O

touchpad O
will O
take O
a O
bit O
of O
time O
to O
get O
used O
to O
. O

we O
both O
recently O
got O
new O
laptops O
. O

i've O
been O
a O
pc O
user O
and O
i O
just O
finally O
switched O
and O
i O
am O
never O
going O
back O
. O

i O
got O
the O
macbook O
and O
he O
got O
a O
macbook O
pro O
. O

winters O
is O
on O
it's O
way O
and O
i O
imagine O
it O
will O
be O
cozy O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
about O
a O
month O
ago O
to O
replace O
my O
compaq O
laptop O
. O

now O
the O
machine O
won't O
connect O
and O
toshiba O
says O
that O
they O
did O
replace O
the O
connection B
card B
in O
may O
but O
they O
only O
warranty B
the O
repair O
for O
<number> O
days O
and O
now O
i'm O
out O
of O
warranty B
even O
though O
this O
has O
been O
a O
constant O
<number> O
month O
occurance O
since O
i O
bought O
the O
netbook O
. O

will O
certainly O
use O
macconnection O
again O
. O

but O
, O
buy O
this O
model O
and O
just O
purchase O
4gb O
of B
ram O
2x2gb O
for O
<number> O
or O
1x4gb O
for O
<number> O
, O
and O
save O
yourself O
<number> O
than O
the O
other O
model O
with O
8gb O
of B
ram O
. O

this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
i O
purchased O
it O
. O

instead O
of O
taking O
another O
chance O
on O
toshiba O
, O
i O
went O
with O
an O
asus O
g73jh O
x3 O
. O

she O
told O
me O
flatly O
, O
it's O
like O
that O
one O
. O

if O
you're O
looking O
for O
something O
to O
fly O
through O
those O
massive O
spreadsheets O
or O
play O
a O
graphics O
intensive O
game B
, O
you'd O
be O
better O
off O
getting O
a O
machine O
aimed O
at O
that O
segment O
of O
the O
market O
. O

it O
is O
the O
easiest O
computer O
i O
have O
ever O
used O

so O
you O
might O
ask O
, O
what O
did O
apple O
do O
for O
me O
? O

browsing O
, O
also O
, O
was O
no O
problem O
for O
me O
when O
i O
used O
itunes B
which O
usually O
slows O
down O
my O
pc O
. O

should O
be O
there O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
week O
again O
. O
. O
. O
. O

again O
, O
decent O
comp O
for O
the O
price B
, O
and O
i O
was O
in O
need O
of O
one O
quickly O
as O
my O
other O
laptop O
died O
on O
me O
. O

so O
in O
a O
brief O
summary O
i O
would O
have O
to O
say O
that O
i O
would O
not O
recommend O
dell O
vostro O
<number> O
to O
anyone O
due O
to O
it O
being O
a O
down O
right O
awful O
setup B
so O
in O
my O
opinion O
you O
should O
steer O
clear O
of O
them O
if O
you O
want O
a O
decent O
laptop O
. O

i O
just O
got O
this O
laptop O
for O
college O
, O
and O
so O
far O
i O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

tosiba O
has O
a O
good O
reputation O
, O
my O
llast O
computer O
was O
an O
acer O
. O

my O
friend O
just O
had O
to O
replace O
his O
entire O
motherboard B
, O
so O
did O
my O
wife O
, O
and O
it O
looks O
like O
i O
will O
have O
to O
as O
well O
. O

toshiba O
customer B
services B
will O
indirectly O
deal O
with O
your O
problems O
by O
constantly O
tranferring O
you O
from O
one O
country O
to O
another O
, O
and O
i O
am O
not O
kidding O
you O
, O
i O
called O
different O
hours O
of O
the O
day O
and O
you'll O
get O
someone O
else O
from O
another O
country O
trying O
to O
get O
you O
to O
tell O
them O
your O
life O
story O
all O
over O
again O
, O
since O
they O
make O
it O
sound O
like O
they O
don't O
have O
your O
history O
list O
of O
your O
calls O
right O
in O
front O
of O
them O
. O

quality B
display O
i O
was O
surprised O
with O
the O
performance B
and O
quality B
of O
this O
hp O
laptop O
. O

the O
battery B
life B
also O
doesn't O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
claim O
but O
still O
i O
think O
macbook O
is O
much O
ahead O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
pack O
. O

the O
internet B
capabilities B
are O
also O
very O
strong O
and O
picks O
up O
signals O
very O
easily O
. O

its O
fast O
, O
has O
high O
definition B
quality B
in O
the O
videos O
. O

they O
transfer O
you O
around O
to O
other O
people O
who O
do O
not O
understand O
what O
you O
are O
saying O
and O
you O
can't O
understand O
what O
they O
are O
saying O
. O

speakers O
don't O
get O
that O
loud O
, O
but O
good O
enough O
. O

i O
have O
had O
it O
<number> O
months O
and O
it O
is O
already O
a O
<number> O
loss O
. O

another O
great O
thing O
is O
the O
beast O
graphics B
. O

i O
was O
wrong O
! O

the O
ease O
of O
set B
up B
was O
terrific O
. O

everything O
i O
have O
tried O
has O
worked O
and O
i O
never O
have O
to O
carry O
the O
wall B
charger B
cause O
the O
battery B
is O
so O
awesome O
. O

screen O
is O
crystal O
clear O
, O
yes O
it's O
small O
but O
it's O
a O
netbook O
! O

so O
this O
review O
might O
be O
a O
tad O
bit O
bias O
. O

this O
was O
around O
three O
years O
, O
maybe O
four O
years O
ago O
. O

the O
battery B
life B
is O
probably O
an O
hour O
at O
best O
. O

this O
is O
a O
review O
of O
windows B
vista B
system B
. O

she O
said O
its O
very O
user O
friendly O
. O

kind O
of O
annoying O
, O
but O
i O
still O
love O
the O
laptop O
. O

cosmetically O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
changed O
was O
<number> O
of O
the O
function O
keys B
at O
the O
top O
. O

i O
am O
very O
happy O
i O
bought O
this O
mac O
, O
well O
worth O
the O
extra O
money O
. O

but O
sadly O
the O
replacement O
froze O
up O
while O
updating O
the O
bios O
again O
and O
shut O
down O
and O
would O
not O
turn O
back O
on O
. O

there's O
literally O
no O
way O
to O
make O
it O
sing O
with O
vista O
. O

after O
looking O
at O
all O
the O
pros O
and O
cons O
, O
i O
decided O
on O
the O
macbook O
pro O
. O

screen O
size B
is O
perfect O
for O
portable O
use O
in O
any O
environment O
. O

first O
, O
it O
does O
not O
have O
a O
push B
button B
to O
open O
the O
lid B
. O

hope O
this O
helped O
! O

i O
used O
to O
build O
my O
own O
desktops O
from O
the O
component O
parts O
, O
and O
recently O
my O
<number> O
year O
old O
pentium O
<number> O
with O
ht O
<number> O
gb O
ram B
sata O
desktop O
stopped O
working O
this O
was O
a O
rock O
star O
<number> O
years O
ago O
. O

i O
now O
realize O
that O
my O
<number> O
would O
have O
been O
better O
spent O
on O
a O
windows O
laptop O
. O

please O
, O
anyone O
who O
is O
considering O
getting O
this O
computer O
, O
stop O
. O

this O
laptop O
serves O
all O
my O
needs O
. O

and O
printing O
from O
either O
word B
processor B
is O
an O
adventure O
. O

very O
satisfied O
. O

do O
not O
buy O
it O
! O

estimated O
time O
to O
fix O
it O
<number> O
working O
days O
or O
less O
. O

after O
purchasing O
this O
thing O
, O
i O
find O
out O
that O
i O
need O
a O
special O
interface B
device B
to O
connect O
my O
camera O
, O
and O
that O
it O
cannot O
be O
purchased O
at O
the O
store O
only O
on O
line O
. O

i O
had O
my O
computer O
custom O
built O
from O
sonystyle O
. O
com O
. O

another O
included B
program B
that O
is O
laughable O
is O
the O
chess O
game O
. O

yes O
, O
i O
thought O
the O
expese B
was O
a O
little O
much O
, O
but O
i O
now O
realize O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

it O
works O
great O
for O
general O
internet B
use B
, O
microsoft O
office O
apps B
, O
home O
bookkeeping O
, O
etc O
. O

i O
will O
not O
buy O
another O
one O
. O

time O
will O
tell O
. O

the O
price B
was O
very O
good O
, O
and O
the O
product O
is O
top O
quality B
. O

this O
computer O
is O
really O
fast O
and O
i'm O
shocked O
as O
to O
how O
easy O
it O
is O
to O
get O
used O
to O
. O
. O
. O

it O
played O
various O
games B
without O
problems O
and O
ran O
aero B
smoothly O
and O
flawlessly O
. O

after O
replacing O
the O
hard B
drive B
the O
battery B
stopped O
working O
<number> O
months O
of O
use O
which O
was O
frustrating O
. O

the O
screen B
almost O
looked O
like O
a O
barcode O
when O
it O
froze O
. O

i O
have O
found O
a O
lot O
of O
online O
sources O
to O
help O
me O
but O
think O
that O
i O
would O
have O
learned O
a O
lot O
quicker O
if O
i O
would O
have O
taken O
the O
class O
. O

from O
the O
get O
go O
, O
the O
m6809 O
was O
unsteady O
in O
its O
operation B
; O

she O
tells O
me O
about O
it O
all O
the O
time O
but O
i O
tend O
to O
shut O
off O
all O
cognitive O
functions O
when O
she O
gets O
that O
yapper O
going O
. O

i O
could O
not O
even O
put O
my O
entire O
music O
collection O
on O
this O
garabage O
. O

one O
of O
the O
wonderful O
things O
about O
macs O
is O
that O
they O
are O
virus O
free O
. O

its O
small O
enough O
where O
i O
can O
take O
it O
pretty O
much O
anywhere O
, O
but O
still O
has O
a O
big O
enough O
screen B
to O
get O
everything O
done O
. O

it O
even O
has O
a O
great O
webcam B
, O
and O
skype O
works O
very O
well O
. O

i O
love O
the O
solid O
machined B
aluminum B
frame B
, O
and O
the O
keyboard B
is O
the O
best O
of O
any O
laptop O
i've O
used O
. O

you O
can O
even O
run O
a O
parallels B
type B
program B
easily O
and O
run O
any O
leftover O
pc O
software B
that O
you O
absolutely O
cannot O
be O
without O
. O

this O
computer O
i O
used O
daily O
nice O
compact O
design B
. O

the O
ati O
graphics B
card B
is O
a O
huge O
plus O
, O
definitely O
a O
good O
value O
if O
you O
need O
to O
be O
able O
to O
run O
some O
slightly O
older O
games B
that O
a O
intel O
built O
in O
card B
would O
have O
trouble O
with O
, O
such O
as O
half O
life O
<number> O
or O
even O
world O
of O
warcraft O
. O

i O
practically O
have O
a O
new O
laptop O
with O
all O
the O
fixes O
they O
have O
done O
! O

finally O
, O
i O
purchased O
a O
toshiba O
. O

it O
was O
hard O
to O
handle B
and O
operate B
at O
school O
. O

you O
may O
just O
lose O
<number> O
customer O
for O
now O
. O

it O
has O
easy O
to O
use O
features B
and O
all O
the O
speed B
and O
power B
i O
could O
ask O
for O
. O

my O
power B
supply B
cord B
developed O
exposed O
wires O
within O
the O
first O
year O
of O
ownership O
, O
so O
it O
was O
covered O
by O
the O
applecare O
warranty B
plan B
. O

many O
thanks O
, O
overstock O
. O
com O
. O

i O
love O
it O
and O
the O
change O
in O
lifestyle O
that O
came O
with O
it O
. O

only O
to O
get O
another O
hp O
compaq O
piece O
of O
crap O
. O

i O
preferred O
the O
fit O
and O
feel O
of O
the O
<number> O
inch B
. O

power B
supply B
went O
bad O
after O
<number> O
weeks O

emachines O
says O
they're O
waiting O
for O
a O
part O
and O
refuses O
to O
replace O
entire O
unit O
. O

the O
screen B
takes O
some O
getting O
use O
to O
, O
because O
it O
is O
smaller O
than O
the O
laptop O
. O

i O
regret O
buying O
it O
before O
understanding O
how O
awful O
it O
is O
to O
use B
. O

the O
right B
speaker B
did O
not O
work O
. O

dealing O
with O
the O
support B
drone O
on O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
chat O
was O
sheer O
torture O
. O

the O
final O
cut O
pro O
on O
this O
laptop O
is O
so O
fast O
and O
easy O
, O
and O
i O
can O
use O
this O
to O
seemlessly O
transfer O
all O
my O
work O
to O
my O
home O
computer O
, O
which O
is O
also O
a O
mac O
. O

the O
computer O
runs B
extremely O
slowly O
, O
whether O
opening O
word O
or O
my O
computer O
. O

but O
i O
am O
glad O
to O
have O
gotten O
mine O
right O
before O
they O
stopped O
making O
it O
. O

the O
mac O
snow O
leopard O
o O
s O
is O
extremely O
easy O
to O
use B
, O
although O
very O
different O
than O
win O
xp O
, O
visa O
or O
win7 O
. O

a O
tip O
for O
people O
looking O
into O
this O
computer O
do O
not O
buy O
it O
save O
up O
a O
bit O
more O
money O
and O
buy O
a O
computer O
that O
will O
last O
. O

i've O
always O
used O
pc's O
for O
work O
home O
and O
this O
is O
my O
first O
experience O
with O
a O
mac O
. O

i O
asked O
many O
people O
, O
search O
on O
the O
net O
and O
also O
read O
reviews O
here O
in O
best O
buy O
. O

startup O
in O
about O
<number> O
seconds O
, O
shutdown B
in O
<number> O
<number> O
seconds O
, O
resume B
from B
sleep B
in O
<number> O
<number> O
seconds O
. O

the O
screen B
is O
nice O
and O
the O
images O
comes O
very O
clear O
, O
the O
keyboard B
and O
the O
fit B
just O
feels O
right O
. O

i O
returned O
it O
to O
best O
buy O
on O
the O
ninteenth O
of O
april O
. O

i O
have O
only O
had O
pcs O
with O
windows O
before O
so O
this O
takes O
a O
little O
getting O
use O
to O
. O

i O
was O
so O
excited O
to O
receive O
the O
toshiba O
l455 O
as O
a O
gift O
bonus O
for O
some O
work O
i O
had O
done O
for O
a O
friend O
of O
mine O
! O

i O
had O
left O
my O
regular O
laptop O
at O
home O
and O
needed O
something O
to O
use O
while O
out O
of O
town O
. O

summary O
after O
doing O
some O
investigation O
on O
the O
web O
, O
i O
have O
found O
that O
toshiba O
nb205s O
are O
not O
chronically O
not O
booting O
. O

super O
fast O
processor B
and O
really O
nice O
graphics B
card B
. O
. O

but O
sitting O
on O
a O
lap O
or O
on O
a O
desk O
in O
front O
of O
you O
it O
looks O
more O
than O
big O
enough O
this O
could O
be O
because O
im O
used O
to O
my O
lenovo O
<number> O
tablet O
now O
plus O
this O
is O
a O
great O
size B
if O
i O
want O
to O
unplug O
the O
external B
keyboard B
, O
mouse B
, O
and O
monitor B
to O
take O
it O
with O
me O
when O
i O
take O
photos O
and O
video O
. O

i O
contacted O
hp O
about O
this O
situation O
and O
was O
given O
excuses O
, O
without O
results O
. O

you O
know O
what O
? O
i O
happened O
to O
buy O
a O
defective O
blood O
pressure O
monitor O
a O
week O
ago O
at O
the O
bukit O
batok O
polyclinic O
nhg O
pharmacy O
a O
week O
ago O
. O

the O
only O
objection O
i O
have O
is O
that O
after O
you O
buy O
it O
the O
windows B
<number> O
system B
is O
a O
starter O
and O
charges O
for O
the O
upgrade O
. O

i O
dislike O
the O
weight B
and O
size B
, O
cubersome O
. O

the O
wheel B
that O
turns O
the O
volume O
up O
and O
down O
doesn't O
work O
in O
real O
time O
. O

i O
can't O
even O
install O
one O
of O
the O
<number> O
printers O
i O
have O
in O
my O
house O
so O
i O
am O
unable O
to O
print O
. O

i O
cannot O
be O
happier O
with O
the O
service B
or O
product O
. O

everything O
was O
so O
easy O
. O

to O
list O
a O
few O
they O
tend O
to O
get O
hot O
enough O
to O
cause O
3rd O
degree O
burns O
, O
as O
well O
as O
ignite O
any O
flamable O
material O
if O
near O
the O
part O
that O
happens O
to O
heat O
up O
. O

got O
this O
for O
a O
graduation O
gift O
for O
my O
daughter O
for O
her O
to O
use O
at O
college O
. O

i O
do O
transcription O
work O
on O
the O
side O
, O
and O
the O
flatline B
keyboard B
makes O
typing O
quick O
and O
easy O
as O
well O
. O

after O
<number> O
months O
of O
failed O
repairs O
, O
requested O
a O
full O
refund O
but O
was O
refused O
and O
it O
still O
is O
not O
repaired O
and O
acer O
is O
indifferent O
to O
the O
issue O
. O

the O
toshiba O
laptop O
was O
a O
great O
purchase O
. O

after O
years O
of O
using O
pcs O
, O
a O
new O
mac O
user O
is O
basically O
forced O
to O
re O
learn O
how O
to O
use O
a O
computer O
. O

speakers O
doesn't O
sound O
that O
great O
. O

you O
better O
believe O
my O
next O
computer O
will O
be O
a O
mac O
! O

i O
love O
it O
! O

i O
love O
windows B
<number> O
but O
i O
can't O
give O
toshiba O
any O
credit O
for O
that O
, O
unless O
y'all O
get O
serious O
about O
ergonomics B
and O
making O
required O
connections B
less O
obtrusive O
i O
will O
be O
looking O
to O
different O
manufacturer O
next O
time O
. O

now O
that O
i O
have O
it O
i O
see O
that O
i O
really O
needed O
this O
for O
much O
more O
. O

after O
numerous O
calls O
to O
applecare O
tech B
support B
, O
i O
was O
directed O
to O
send O
in O
my O
computer O
; O

the O
abuse O
is O
that O
i O
pushed O
the O
power B
plug B
in O
too O
hard O
. O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
find O
documents O
, O
and O
keep O
them O
in O
one O
area O
. O

the B
resolution B
on B
the B
screen B
is O
almost O
pure O
hd O
. O

with O
all O
the O
programs B
that O
came O
with O
it O
, O
such O
as O
ilife O
and O
iwork O
, O
i O
was O
set O
from O
the O
very O
beginning O
. O

not O
sure O
how O
i O
recommend O
it O
for O
quality O
gaming B
, O
as O
i O
have O
a O
desktop O
rig O
for O
that O
reason O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
netbook O
for O
traveling O
, O
and O
it's O
great O
light O
, O
functional O
, O
and O
meets O
my O
needs O
. O

easy O
learning O
curve O
. O

i O
go O
to O
purchase O
it O
on O
line O
, O
and O
i O
find O
out O
that O
the O
device O
will O
not O
be O
available O
until O
almost O
two O
months O
later O
! O

dell O
is O
a O
decently O
made O
pc O
. O

great O
value B
, O
fast O
delivery B
computer O
works O
as O
if O
brand O
new O
, O
no O
problems O
, O
very O
pleased O

the O
internet O
explorer O
was O
very O
slow O
from O
the O
very O
beginning O
. O

the O
ac O
power B
port B
becomes O
loose O
over O
time O

best O
buy O
laughed O
when O
i O
told O
them O
they O
should O
replace O
it O
instead O
of O
expecting O
me O
to O
be O
without O
a O
computer O
again O
for O
another O
couple O
of O
weeks O
. O

as O
a O
user O
of O
a O
pc O
, O
i O
will O
will O
admit O
that O
the O
macbook O
pro O
has O
a O
better O
running B
system B
in O
which O
i O
found O
myself O
getting O
the O
job O
done O
quicker O
. O

the O
computer O
would O
not O
ever O
cut O
back O
on O
. O

the O
ease O
in O
which O
you O
set O
everything O
up O
is O
such O
that O
a O
child O
could O
do O
it O
. O

i O
would O
have O
to O
say O
that O
overall O
its O
great O
! O

there O
are O
no O
gold O
key O
numbers O
too O
intall O
programs B
, O
you O
must O
use O
the O
serial O
numbers O
that O
it O
does O
not O
accept O
and O
then O
things O
are O
limited O
as O
far O
a O
working O
because O
they O
are O
only O
good O
for O
a O
short O
time O
. O

and O
they O
replaced O
the O
awesome O
ergonomic O
small O
lightweight O
power B
supply B
with O
a O
power B
supply B
that O
weighed O
more O
than O
the O
machine O
itself O
. O

it's O
the O
inside O
that O
is O
truly O
wonderful O
. O

enjoy O
that O
toshib O
force B
and O
durability B
unparalleled O

i O
purchased O
this O
laptop O
<number> O
months O
ago O
! O

which O
is O
great O
i O
am O
running O
vista O
business O
and O
scored O
a O
<number> O
. O
x O
on O
the O
index O
i O
have O
never O
seen O
a O
windows O
machine O
have O
a O
total O
score O
in O
the O
5's O
. O

returning O
this O
as O
soon O
as O
i O
get O
out O
of O
work O

i O
use O
the B
computer O
to O
basically O
check O
emails O
, O
surf B
the B
web B
, O
print O
coupons O
and O
for O
my O
college O
papers O
. O

this O
unit O
is O
not O
. O

we O
love O
the B
size B
of B
the B
screen B
, O
although O
it O
is O
still O
lightweight O
and O
very O
easy O
to O
tote B
around O
. O

they O
aren't O
worth O
the O
money O
, O
even O
though O
they O
are O
on O
the O
cheap O
side O
, O
laptop O
speaking O
. O

either O
way O
the O
entire O
thing O
was O
just O
a O
joke O
, O
a O
complete O
rip O
off O
! O

so O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
computer O
does O
not O
work B
on O
the O
<number> O
twenty O
fourth O
day O
is O
my O
fault O
. O

so O
glad O
i O
decided O
to O
upgrade O
! O

i O
would O
definitely O
reccomend O
this O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
market O
for O
an O
easy O
to O
use B
, O
stylish O
, O
fun O
, O
awesome O
computer O
. O

the O
battery B
is O
irreplaceable O
. O

if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
laptop O
, O
this O
is O
not O
it O
! O

if O
you O
want O
a O
little O
more O
custom O
ability O
, O
drop O
a O
few O
bucks O
and O
upgrade O
to O
one O
of B
the O
more O
robust O
versions O
of B
win O
<number> O
and O
grab O
a O
2gb O
stick B
of B
memory B
to O
spice O
it O
all O
up O
a O
bit O
more O
. O

it's O
catatonic O
. O

i O
have O
never O
really O
been O
big O
on O
downloading O
anything O
so O
i O
wasn't O
too O
worried O
about O
getting O
a O
virus O
, O
plus O
i O
thought O
i O
was O
protected O
by O
norton O
. O

the O
internet B
was O
locekd O
and O
froze O
every O
time O
it O
was O
trying O
to O
be O
used O
, O
and O
the O
command B
prompt B
would O
not O
work O
at O
all O
. O

it's O
software B
and O
speed B
enable O
it O
to O
do O
amazing O
things O
. O

the O
toshiba O
satellite O
laptop O
is O
designed O
to O
fail O
! O

he O
came O
into O
my O
house O
, O
fiddled O
around O
on O
the O
computer O
for O
a O
good O
forty O
minutes O
and O
got O
ready O
to O
leave O
before O
it O
was O
even O
done O
doing O
what O
he O
was O
doing O
to O
it O
. O

my O
wireless O
provider O
confirmed O
my O
home O
internet O
is O
fine O
, O
and O
any O
connections O
i O
turn O
on O
should O
work O
. O

could O
not O
keep O
up O
with O
me O
and O
finally O
the O
hard B
drive B
went O
out O
. O

i O
could O
have O
purchased O
a O
cheap O
computer O
to O
do O
what O
i'm O
doing O
now O
! O

i O
am O
most O
impressed O
with O
the O
programming B
, O
including O
the O
iphoto O
. O

speakers O
too O
small O
to O
be O
of O
any O
real O
use O
. O

i O
upgraded O
it's O
ram O
to O
2gb O
, O
i O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
. O

this O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
. O

i O
purchased O
a O
toshiba O
satellite O
m60 O
with O
harman O
kardon O
speakers B
! O
in O
december O
of O
<number> O
. O

dismantle O
the O
whole O
thing O
? O
then O
it O
will O
not O
be O
a O
newly O
manufactured O
set O
like O
before O
. O

they O
should O
have O
included O
more O
memory B
on O
their O
computers O
if O
they O
knew O
vista O
would O
run O
slowly O
. O

battery O
life B
could O
be O
better O
but O
overall O
for O
the O
price B
and O
toshiba's O
reputation O
for O
laptops O
it's O
great O
! O

the O
battery B
never O
held O
a O
charge B
longer O
than O
one O
hour O
and O
within O
two O
months O
, O
stopped O
holding O
a O
charge B
for O
more O
than O
ten O
minutes O
. O

it O
wouldn't O
fit O
in O
most O
<number> O
inch O
bags O
. O

the O
first O
time O
it O
crashed O
was O
maybe O
going O
on O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
of O
having O
it O
. O

after O
the O
warrenty B
expired O
the O
hard B
drive B
went O
bad O
and O
it O
would O
have O
cost O
more O
to O
fix O
then O
to O
replace O
. O

i O
paid O
<number> O
for O
this O
computer O
from O
my O
school O
campus O
bookstore O
. O

it O
is O
small O
enough O
to O
fit O
in O
one O
of O
my O
purses O
! O

the O
windows O
<number> O
starter O
is O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
a O
great O
way O
to O
think O
about O
using O
your O
netbook O
basics O
, O
basics O
, O
basics O
. O

i O
was O
very O
worried O
about O
making O
the O
two O
compatible O
but O
literally O
, O
it O
was O
so O
simple O
i O
was O
almost O
worried O
that O
i O
was O
doing O
something O
wrong O
. O

note O
that O
i O
don't O
ordinarily O
take O
the O
time O
to O
write O
a O
review O
. O

the O
neat O
and O
organized O
icon B
list B
is O
a O
welcome O
change O
from O
cluttered O
and O
confusing O
desktop B
icons B
. O

i O
purchased O
this O
netbook O
after O
my O
original O
toshiba O
laptop O
crashed O
right O
after O
the O
warranty B
expired O
. O

apparently O
well O
built B
and O
gorgeous O
to O
look B
at O
, O
the O
i5 O
macbook O
pro O
is O
a O
winning O
combination O
of O
price B
and O
performance B
. O

asus O
has O
done O
an O
outstanding O
job O
of O
evolving O
their O
netbooks O
, O
and O
i O
would O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
who O
both O
understands O
their O
needs O
and O
how O
netbooks O
can O
fit O
them O
. O

the O
apple B
care B
has O
never O
failed O
me O
, O
and O
i O
expect O
it O
to O
be O
the O
same O
for O
this O
computer O
as O
well O
. O

buyer O
beware O
. O

it O
has O
served O
my O
needs O
quite O
nicely O
for O
the O
most O
part O
. O

the O
toshiba O
laptop O
i O
am O
using O
is O
easier O
to O
use B
than O
most O
i O
have O
tried O
. O

so O
i O
called O
compaq O
, O
and O
after O
being O
on O
the O
phone O
for O
<number> O
hours O
, O
i O
finally O
got O
a O
replacement O
which O
i O
shouldn't O
have O
had O
a O
problem O
getting O
since O
it O
was O
under O
warranty B
. O

so O
we O
exchanged O
it O
for O
the O
same O
on O
and O
after O
<number> O
hours O
it O
didn't O
work B
. O

do O
not O
buy O
you O
will O
be O
disappointed O
. O

i O
just O
recently O
had O
to O
ship O
my O
laptop O
back O
to O
hp O
for O
repair O
. O

i O
have O
had O
to O
take O
it O
to O
the O
geek O
squad O
guys O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
because O
it O
has O
had O
viruses O
<number> O
times O
and O
i O
have O
not O
even O
had O
it O
for O
more O
then O
<number> O
months O
! O

we O
don't O
mind O
and O
you O
don't O
matter O
. O

i O
love O
the O
size B
, O
keyboard B
, O
the O
functions B
. O

but O
as O
time O
went O
on O
i O
found O
it O
almost O
impossible O
to O
keep O
the O
thing O
on O
line O
through O
wi O
fi O
. O

the O
mouse B
is O
way O
way O
way O
to O
sensitve O
. O

toshiba O
knows O
there O
is O
a O
manufacturing O
defect O
but O
will O
not O
acknowledge O
it O
. O

the O
os O
is O
still O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
day O
that O
the O
laptop O
was O
purchased O
and O
continues O
to O
run B
flawlessly O
. O

also O
, O
i O
issued O
a O
replacement O
rma O
for O
a O
few O
dead O
pixels O
in O
the O
upper O
zone O
of O
the O
screen B
, O
which O
is O
noticable O
to O
me O
. O

waited O
on O
getting O
this O
computer O
, O
but O
it O
has O
been O
a O
great O
change O
. O

after O
way O
too O
many O
times O
sending O
the O
thing O
in O
for O
repairs O
delivery B
service B
was O
slow O
, O
and O
without O
the O
laptop O
i O
had O
no O
access O
to O
the O
internet O
, O
and O
thus O
no O
way O
of O
tracking O
it O
to O
find O
out O
when O
i O
might O
hope O
to O
see O
my O
computer O
again O
, O
it O
finally O
kicked O
the O
bucket O
after O
just O
over O
<number> O
years O
. O

my O
friend O
reports O
the O
notebook O
is O
astonishing O
in O
performance B
, O
picture B
quality B
, O
and O
ease O
of O
use B
. O

the O
i3 B
processor B
doesn't O
seem O
to O
run O
hot O
and O
the O
fan B
rarely O
turns O
on O
. O

i O
was O
getting O
extrememly O
frustrated O
when O
i O
would O
want O
to O
do O
these O
simple O
taks O
that O
i O
would O
have O
to O
wait O
and O
wait O
and O
wait O
for O
things O
to O
download O
or O
virus O
that O
would O
clog O
up O
my O
pc O
. O

enjoy O
your O
sitdown O

the O
battery B
never O
held O
a O
charge B
longer O
than O
one O
hour O
and O
within O
two O
months O
, O
stopped O
holding O
a O
charge B
for O
more O
than O
ten O
minutes O
. O

another O
three O
weeks O
later O
i O
had O
my O
laptop O
back O
with O
a O
new O
mousepad B
, O
keys B
, O
and O
casing B
. O

i O
have O
had O
my O
new O
macbook O
pro O
i5 O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
and O
have O
recycled O
all O
of O
my O
old O
pc O
laptops O
. O

see O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
laptops O
you O
buy O
it O
and O
get O
just O
a O
normal O
operating B
system B
with O
trials O
of O
must O
need O
stuff O
that O
should O
come O
with O
it O
. O

the B
only O
thing O
i O
don't O
understand O
is O
that O
the B
resolution B
of B
the B
screen B
isn't O
high O
enough O
for O
some O
pages O
, O
such O
as O
yahoo O
! O
mail O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
wish O
this O
had O
was O
the O
option O
to O
turn O
off O
the O
touchpad B
with O
a O
button O
like O
my O
big O
<number> O
laptop O
does O
. O

very O
convenient O
when O
you O
travel O
and O
the O
battery B
life B
is O
excellent O
. O
. O
. O

the O
machine O
is O
slow O
to O
boot B
up B
and O
occasionally O
crashes O
completely O
. O

this O
is O
great O
if O
you O
have O
several O
lectures O
back O
to O
back O
and O
don't O
have O
a O
chance O
to O
charge B
during O
one O
of O
the O
lectures O
. O

i O
wish O
toshiba O
would O
allow O
their O
customers O
to O
select O
an O
option O
that O
only O
boots O
the O
os O
at O
setup O
and O
removes O
all O
the O
unnecessary O
stuff O
. O

at O
first O
it's O
like O
you're O
in O
that O
honeymoon O
stage O
with O
your O
laptop O
. O

i O
didn't O
want O
to O
buy O
a O
generic O
brand O
computer O
but O
it O
is O
really O
nice O
. O

i O
can O
use O
it O
for O
all O
of O
my O
needs O
. O

after O
doing O
cad O
work O
all O
day O
at O
work O
, O
using O
a O
higher O
end O
pc O
, O
i O
couldn't O
come O
home O
and O
settle O
for O
the O
use O
of O
a O
lower O
end O
computer O
. O

the O
screen B
brightness B
automatically O
adjusts O
. O

i O
especially O
like O
the O
backlit B
keyboard B
. O

either O
way O
i'm O
furious O
. O

besides O
the O
great O
look B
, O
it O
is O
a O
great O
machine O
. O

my O
laptop O
cost B
approximately O
<number> O
, O
<number> O
and O
died O
after O
only O
<number> O
years O
, O
<number> O
months O
and O
<number> O
days O
of O
use O
. O

the O
sound B
is O
a O
bit O
quiet O
if O
you're O
on O
a O
plane O
, O
this O
can O
easily O
be O
overcome O
with O
a O
decent O
pair O
of O
head O
phones O
. O

i O
was O
not O
aware O
that O
this O
product O
cannot O
display O
websites O
that O
contain O
flash O
. O

this O
computer O
was O
bought O
because O
i O
wanted O
top O
of O
the O
line O
, O
fast O
, O
reliable O
, O
ha O
. O

a O
lot O
of O
help O
they O
weren't O
! O

the O
sata O
controller B
is O
the O
motherboard B
chip B
that O
lets O
the O
cpu O
talk O
to O
the O
hard B
drive B
. O

i O
will O
never O
buy O
anything O
from O
hp O
again O
! O

i O
can't O
imagine O
ever O
buying O
a O
pc O
again O
! O

the O
buttons B
you O
have O
to O
press O
a O
little O
harder O
than O
most O
. O

the O
battery B
life B
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
<number> O
hours O
, O
but O
even O
if O
i O
ran O
off O
the O
battery B
with O
the O
high O
effeciency O
setting O
the O
battery B
would O
only O
last O
me O
on O
average O
about O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
to O
<number> O
hours O
. O

it O
allows O
you O
to O
automatically O
upload O
photos O
to O
your O
facebook O
account O
with O
one O
click O
. O

took O
it O
back O
as O
it O
was O
defective O
. O

other O
thoughts O
i O
love O
newegg O
, O
i O
recommend O
them O
to O
the O
world O
however O
this O
is O
just O
unacceptable O
. O

now O
<number> O
months O
later O
they O
want O
would O
not O
say O
exact O
amount O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
to O
<number> O
to O
fix O
the O
machine O
. O

i O
simply O
got O
tired O
of O
a O
bad O
computer O
like O
windows O
with O
its O
constant O
freezing O
and O
anti O
virus O
. O

i O
am O
not O
one O
to O
throw O
things O
like O
this O
around O
but O
it O
is O
a O
laptop O
so O
carrying O
it O
around O
does O
seem O
to O
mean O
it O
will O
be O
jerked O
possibly O
a O
little O
, O
while O
driving O
a O
car O
and O
carrying O
it O
into O
where O
ever O
you O
are O
using O
it O
. O

right O
size B
and O
weight B
for O
portability B
. O

we O
decided O
we O
would O
try O
to O
trade O
in O
our O
old O
ones O
. O

so O
far O
, O
so O
good O
! O

it O
took O
a O
little O
over O
<number> O
weeks O
until O
i O
got O
it O
back O
. O

eventually O
the O
screen O
went O
blank O
and O
the O
computer O
would O
not O
turn O
on O
. O

the O
battery B
life B
also O
doesn't O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
claim O
but O
still O
i O
think O
macbook O
is O
much O
ahead O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
pack O
. O

it O
was O
loaded O
with O
windows O
vista O
home O
premium O
delivered O
with O
only O
1gb O
of B
ram O
, O
and O
it O
was O
a O
dog O
. O

what O
a O
waste O
of O
time O
it O
was O
to O
run O
a O
defrag O
on O
the O
pc O
! O

the O
reflectiveness O
of O
the O
display B
is O
only O
a O
minor O
inconvenience O
if O
you O
work O
in O
a O
controlled O
lighting O
environment O
like O
me O
i O
prefer O
it O
dark O
or O
if O
you O
can O
crank O
up O
the O
brightness B
. O

my O
one O
complaint O
with O
this O
laptop O
is O
that O
i've O
noticed O
an O
electronic B
fuzz B
sound B
coming O
out O
of O
the O
headphone B
jack B
when O
headphones O
are O
plugged O
in O
. O

this O
system O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
money O
or O
trouble O
trying O
to O
get O
it O
fix O
. O

update O
two O
years O
after O
buying O
this O
laptop O
, O
i O
am O
now O
the O
proud O
owner O
of O
a O
lemon O
. O

while O
it O
was O
highly O
rated O
, O
would O
i O
like O
it O
? O
i O
tried O
the O
keyboard B
at O
the O
store O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
ok O
. O

treat O
yourself O
to O
a O
more O
expensive O
, O
long O
lasting O
laptop O
of O
quality B
like O
a O
sony O
, O
apple O
, O
or O
toshiba O
. O

i O
love O
it O
never O
had O
a O
computer O
i O
was O
so O
impressed O
with O
and O
i've O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
laptops O
and O
desktops O
this O
one O
is O
far O
and O
above O
the O
best O
one O
i O
ever O
had O
before O
. O

we O
did O
not O
even O
have O
it O
a O
year O
. O

i O
have O
had O
to O
call O
with O
a O
few O
questions O
or O
issues O
and O
they O
have O
helped O
me O
for O
free O
, O
even O
without O
the O
warranty B
. O

so O
you O
out O
of O
of O
notebook O
and O
money O
. O

was O
searching O
online O
for O
a O
power B
supply B
when O
i O
found O
this O
site O
. O

but O
to O
be O
honest O
, O
i O
don't O
use O
my O
computer O
for O
anything O
like O
graphics B
editing B
and O
complex B
data B
analysis B
and O
gaming B
. O

i O
would O
rather O
spend O
my O
money O
on O
a O
computer O
that O
costs B
more O
then O
a O
toshiba O
that O
isn't O
good O
at O
all O
. O

no O
problem O
with O
the O
ordering O
or O
shipping B
by O
the O
way O
. O

and O
the B
ram B
the B
thing O
that O
makes O
it O
faster O
comes O
sporting O
<number> O
gigs O
for O
high O
performance B
to O
handle O
more O
stuff O
at O
once O
and O
surf B
the B
web B
a O
whole O
lot O
faster O
than O
before O
. O

the O
one O
thing O
i O
wish O
it O
had O
was O
a O
detailed O
hardcopy B
manuel B
. O

i O
edit O
and O
burn O
to O
dvd O
a O
lot O
of O
video O
, O
so O
i O
obviously O
could O
not O
live O
with O
a O
non O
functioning O
drive B
. O

fast O
, O
great O
visual B
! O

it's O
priced B
very O
reasonable O
and O
works B
very O
well O
right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

you O
will O
need O
them O
if O
you O
want O
to O
reload O
the O
os O
i O
recommend O
doing O
if O
you O
can O
to O
start O
fresh O
and O
optimal O
. O

apple O
and O
quess O
what O
, O
you O
have O
to O
send O
the O
whole O
laptop O
in O
, O
too O
bad O
, O
so O
sad O

if O
you O
could O
stretch O
by O
a O
few O
<number> O
dollars O
i O
highly O
recommend O
you O
should O
replace O
your O
windows O
laptop O
with O
this O
one O
. O

might O
have O
to O
buy O
one O
for O
me O
now O
, O
since O
i O
use O
it O
all O
the O
time O
. O

while O
the O
keyboard B
itself O
is O
alright O
, O
the O
plate B
around O
it O
is O
cheap O
plastic O
and O
makes O
a O
hollow O
sound O
when O
using O
the O
mouse B
command B
buttons B
. O

i O
purchased O
it O
this O
year O
when O
my O
old O
hp O
laptop O
finally O
died O
and O
i O
was O
looking O
for O
something O
smaller O
and O
lighter O
than O
a O
laptop O
to O
carry O
around O
for O
classes O
and O
traveling O
. O

i O
have O
a O
friend O
who O
has O
the O
other O
model O
and O
we O
put O
them O
side O
by O
side O
with O
the O
same O
dvd O
in O
battle O
of O
the O
smithsonian O
after O
on O
hour O
mine O
was O
at O
<number> O
life O
left O
and O
his O
was O
at O
<number> O
life O
left O
. O

the O
latest O
is O
on O
my O
lg O
netbook O
x12 O

purchased O
as O
a O
gift O
for O
a O
friend O
. O

i O
would O
not O
recommend O
the O
purchase O
of O
this O
modle O
of O
toshiba O
computer O
or O
any O
toshiba O
product O
for O
that O
matter O
. O

i've O
never O
had O
problems O
with O
viruses O
. O

after O
they O
found O
no O
other O
way O
, O
they O
told O
me O
to O
courier O
it O
to O
them O
since O
they O
don't O
allow O
the O
use O
of O
the O
post O
office O
at O
my O
expense O
, O
and O
sent O
me O
a O
<number> O
page O
list O
of O
very O
specific O
packaging O
instructions O
to O
follow O
or O
it O
wouldn't O
be O
covered O
. O

there O
are O
so O
many O
wonderful O
features B
and O
benefits O
to O
the O
new O
macbook O
! O

the O
mcbook O
pro O
notebook O
will O
make O
it O
easy O
for O
you O
to O
write O
and O
read O
your O
emails O
at O
blazing O
speeds B
. O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
can O
say O
is O
that O
the O
touch B
pad B
doesnt O
work O
like O
it O
should O
all O
the O
time O
. O

however O
, O
i O
love O
this O
particular O
mac O
because O
its O
very O
fast O
, O
great O
size B
, O
and O
has O
fantastic O
features B
like O
the O
lighted B
keyboard B
and O
easy O
mouse B
pad B
. O

battery O
life B
needs O
more O
life B
. O

for O
some O
odd O
reasons O
the O
computer O
doesn't O
reconize O
the O
operation B
system B
. O

i O
had O
to O
wait O
<number> O
weeks O
to O
get O
it O
back O
and O
it O
still O
is O
not O
working O
properly O
. O

i O
am O
going O
to O
go O
back O
and O
return O
at O
store O
i O
bought O
from O
! O

the O
trackpad B
was O
easy O
to O
learn O
and O
navigate O
. O

applications O
open O
in O
seconds O
and O
there O
are O
no O
lags O
, O
hiccups O
or O
awkward O
moments O
when O
you O
wonder O
whether O
your O
computer O
is O
out O
for O
tea O
. O

my O
husband O
purchased O
a O
laptop O
at O
the O
same O
time O
for O
about O
<number> O
less O
he O
got O
a O
pc O
. O

i O
respond O
that O
i O
do O
not O
have O
the O
old O
computer O
and O
this O
way O
i O
would O
lose O
the O
data O
on O
my O
hard B
drive B
. O

again O
in O
february O
my O
computer O
completely O
failed O
to O
the O
point O
that O
it O
could O
not O
load O
windows O
so O
i O
contacted O
acer O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
thru O
my O
warrenty O
and O
it O
took O
about O
<number> O
days O
fighting O
on O
the O
phone O
with O
agents B
and O
it O
seemed O
as O
though O
none O
of O
them O
spoke O
english O
. O

i O
think O
this O
ps O
was O
manufactured O
in O
the O
mid O
90's O
. O

both O
upgrades O
were O
quickly O
accomplished O
after O
purchasing O
the O
necessary O
product O
key O
. O

i O
have O
owned O
it O
only O
two O
months O
! O

i O
love O
my O
macbook O
pro O
! O

from O
the O
moment O
i O
opened O
the O
box O
to O
the O
present O
it O
has O
been O
a O
great O
joy O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
emachines O
notebook O
pc O
in O
january O
of O
this O
year O
and O
i O
am O
highly O
dissatisfied O
with O
it O
. O

even O
though O
the O
computer O
is O
larger O
they O
did O
not O
make O
the O
keyboard B
larger O
. O

thanks O
, O
macconnection O
, O
for O
making O
this O
a O
seamless O
purchase O
! O

we O
paid O
for O
the O
three B
year B
warranty B
and O
the O
extended B
warranty B
after O
that O
one O
ended O
as O
well O
. O

its O
not O
just O
slow O
on O
the O
internet B
, O
its O
slow O
in O
general O
. O

it O
has O
just O
enough O
ram O
to O
run O
smoothly O
and O
enough O
memory B
to O
satisfy O
my O
needs O
. O

the O
difference O
is O
phenomenal O
. O

i O
acually O
believe O
the O
issue O
is O
with O
the O
nvidia O
grafics B
card B
, O
but O
still O
requires O
a O
return O
. O

i O
am O
a O
freelance O
graphic O
artist O
. O

no O
waiting O
to O
have O
my O
claim O
reviewed O
by O
someone O
in O
another O
state O
or O
more O
often O
, O
another O
country O
. O

i O
did O
not O
like O
my O
acer O
. O

my O
husband O
got O
me O
this O
for O
chrismas O
after O
getting O
me O
a O
very O
expensve O
laptop O
that O
did O
not O
work B
after O
<number> O
days O
. O

problem O
fixed O
which O
is O
great O
but O
there O
went O
another O
two O
weeks O
without O
my O
laptop O
at O
school O
. O

the O
resolution B
is O
even O
higher O
then O
any O
other O
laptop O
on O
the O
market O
. O

then O
just O
the O
other O
day O
, O
my O
left B
mouse O
button B
snapped O
! O

it O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
type B
on O
and O
feels O
great O
besides O
the O
added O
feature B
that O
the O
keyboard B
is O
lighted O
. O

laptop O
is O
advertised O
as O
a O
<number> O
but O
the O
casing B
looks O
like O
that O
of O
a O
<number> O
. O

remember O
to O
do O
your O
research O
first O
before O
consider O
buying O
a O
toshiba O
product O
. O

i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
the O
moment O
unibody O
product O
came O
to O
the O
market O
. O

the O
only O
time O
i O
have O
restarted O
is O
during O
system O
updates O
. O

mac O
is O
extremely O
different O
than O
any O
other O
laptop O
. O

the O
feel B
of O
this O
machine O
compared O
to O
the O
old O
macbook O
is O
far O
superior O
. O

in O
due O
course O
, O
i'll O
remove O
the O
hard B
disc B
from O
this O
new O
macbook O
pro O
and O
dump O
it O
where O
it O
belongs O
in O
the O
trash O
. O

it's O
great O
and O
we O
will O
always O
stick O
with O
apple O
computers O
, O
we O
have O
been O
so O
happy O
with O
them O
. O

i O
should O
have O
realized O
that O
trouble O
was O
brewing O
. O

they O
break O
down O
just O
as O
often O
as O
pcs O
do O
, O
and O
the O
only O
reason O
they O
don't O
get O
viruses O
, O
is O
because O
no O
one O
makes O
viruses O
for B
them O
, O
they're O
not O
better O
in O
any O
way O
, O
they O
are O
worse O
, O
try O
finding O
virus B
protection B
programs B
for B
a B
mac O
, O
they O
don't O
exist O
. O

thank O
you O
. O

the O
benefits O
were O
immediate O
! O

much O
faster O
than O
my O
old O
windows O
laptop O
that O
died O
on O
me O
. O

never O
any O
doubt O
i O
would O
get O
a O
macbook O
, O
just O
wasn't O
sure O
which O
one O
. O

but O
with O
a O
way O
bigger O
screen O
, O
and O
is O
able O
to O
connect O
to O
an O
hdmi O
. O

the O
graphics B
are O
awful O
and O
the O
wireless B
switch B
it O
at O
the O
top O
rather O
than O
the O
side O
which O
i O
am O
used O
to O
it O
being O
on O
the O
side O
. O

the O
overall O
build B
quality B
of O
the O
unit O
is O
excellent O
and O
she'd O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
else O
looking O
for O
a O
netbook O
. O

i O
bought O
my O
acer O
aspire O
custom O
made O
in O
june O
<number> O
. O

i O
guess O
he O
was O
the O
technical B
person B
. O

they O
click O
. O

a O
seventy O
dollar O
mouse B
! O

the O
repairs O
were O
made O
quickly O
though O
i O
must O
say O
, O
however O
the O
second O
time O
they O
shipped B
it O
to O
the O
incorrect O
address O
and O
it O
took O
nearly O
a O
week O
for O
them O
to O
get O
it O
to O
me O
. O

i O
have O
the O
a65 O
right O
now O
it's O
a O
paperweight O
. O

when O
i O
first O
got O
it O
i O
thought O
the O
size B
of O
it O
was O
a O
joke O
. O

that O
being O
said O
, O
it O
still O
runs O
video O
in O
full O
screen O
decently O
. O

it O
is O
fast O
and O
i O
have O
not O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
internet B
connection B
or O
any O
other O
problems O
. O

i'm O
really O
impressed O
with O
the O
quality B
and O
performance B
for O
the O
price B
of O
the O
computer O
. O

but O
when O
i O
received O
my O
replacement O
, O
i O
made O
both O
recovery B
dvds O
<number> O
, O
and O
a O
driver O
application O
dvd O
. O

in O
addition O
, O
there O
is O
photo B
detection B
software B
that O
will O
allow O
you O
to O
group O
all O
the O
photos O
together O
based O
upon O
the O
people O
in O
the O
picture O
. O

the O
speakers B
are O
terrible O
and O
are O
probably O
the O
cheapest O
ones O
i O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
a O
laptop O
so O
if O
your O
planning O
to O
listen O
to O
music O
i O
suggest O
you O
get O
something O
better O
. O

so O
then O
you O
may O
be O
lucky O
to O
get O
ahold O
to O
someone O
who O
understands O
that O
its O
no O
good O
and O
they O
will O
let O
you O
send O
it O
back O
, O
but O
of O
course O
you O
are O
taking O
a O
chance O
of O
them O
testing O
it O
out O
to O
see O
what O
has O
happened O
, O
and O
they O
tell O
you O
that O
it O
was O
not O
on O
their O
side O
, O
then O
you O
are O
stuck O
paying O
for O
the O
repair O
the O
price B
of O
a O
new O
one O
. O

what's O
really O
great O
about O
this O
product O
is O
you O
may O
have O
a O
family O
member O
who O
is O
computer O
illiterate O
and O
you O
can O
pretty O
much O
just O
let O
them O
loose O
on O
this O
computer O
without O
any O
real O
supervision O
. O

the O
lesson O
learned O
here O
is O
it O
does O
not O
pay O
to O
by O
this O
loyal O
to O
any O
brand O
, O
since O
all O
of O
them O
are O
there O
to O
simply O
to O
make O
as O
much O
money O
as O
possible O
, O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
, O
and O
in O
this O
day O
and O
age O
, O
the O
customer O
no O
longer O
is O
right O
all O
the O
times O
. O

pdf O
files O
can O
be O
viewed O
instantly O
. O

dell O
latitude O
d620 O
is O
not O
a O
reliable O
machine O
. O

i O
have O
had O
it O
for O
almost O
four O
years O
now O
and O
i O
have O
only O
had O
a O
few O
problems O
with O
it O
. O

overall O
for O
the O
money O
this O
is O
a O
good O
deal O
. O

it O
is O
so O
simple O
to O
use B
, O
i O
use B
it O
more O
than O
my O
desktop O
. O

i O
also O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
touchpad B
that O
caused O
the O
mouse B
pointer B
to O
jump O
all O
over O
the O
screen B
. O

i O
saved O
for O
this O
laptop O
for O
<number> O
months O
and O
i O
can O
tell O
you O
personally O
it O
was O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

i O
own O
a O
hewlett O
packard O
laptop O
and O
i've O
had O
man O
problems O
with O
it O
since O
i O
bought O
in O
in O
feb O
, O
<number> O

it O
has O
a O
overheating O
issue O
nearly O
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
dangerous O
. O

i O
have O
had O
no O
problems O
with O
it O
unlike O
some O
hardware B
defects O
on O
past O
models O
. O

either O
way O
, O
the O
keyboard O
is O
unsatisfactory O
. O

well O
, O
i O
have O
to O
say O
since O
i O
bought O
my O
mac O
, O
i O
won't O
ever O
go O
back O
to O
any O
windows O
. O

i O
took O
it O
in O
to O
the O
apple O
store O
and O
guess O
what O
? O
they O
fixed O
it O
, O
no O
cost B
out O
of O
pocket O
. O

i O
have O
used O
different O
laptops O
in O
the O
past O
and O
i O
have O
to O
rate O
this O
one O
way O
above O
the O
rest O
. O

i O
love O
the O
mac O
so O
much O
better O
than O
my O
work O
pc O
! O

the O
quality B
, O
engineering B
design B
and O
warranty B
are O
superior O
covers O
damage O
from O
dropping O
the O
laptop O
. O

i O
recommend O
the O
macbook O
pro O
if O
you O
want O
the O
best O
laptop O
on O
the O
market O
. O

the O
applications B
are O
also O
very O
easy O
to O
find O
and O
maneuver O
, O
much O
easier O
than O
any O
other O
computer O
i O
have O
ever O
owned O
. O

the O
large O
screen B
gives O
you O
the O
option O
to O
comfortably O
watch O
movies O
or O
tv O
shows O
on O
your O
computer O
instead O
of O
buying O
an O
additional O
tv O
for O
your O
dorm O
room O
. O

small O
and O
light O
weight O
. O

great O
laptop O
for O
school O
, O
easy O
to O
use B
for O
beginners O
in O
the O
household O
. O

he O
didn't O
work O
for O
sony O
, O
he O
was O
just O
approved O
to O
fix O
their O
crappy O
products O
. O

<number> O
laptop O
still O
did O
not O
work B
, O
blue O
screen O
within O
a O
week O
. O
. O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
that O
isn't O
perfect O
about O
this O
netbook O
is O
the O
speakers B
, O
they O
are O
not O
loud O
at O
all O
but O
i O
expected O
that O
. O

bought O
for O
my O
daughter O
to O
take O
for O
starting O
college O
this O
fall O
she O
has O
been O
on O
it O
non O
stop O
ever O
since O
learning O
how O
to O
use O
it O
. O

never O
had O
a O
single O
problem O
, O
and O
don't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
viruses O
. O

of O
course O
, O
i O
inspected O
the O
other O
netbooks O
and O
clearly O
their O
hinges B
are O
tighter O
and O
i O
even O
demonstrate O
the O
difference O
between O
my O
netbook O
and O
others O
. O

not O
to O
mention O
the O
fact O
that O
your O
mac O
comes O
fully O
loaded O
with O
all O
necessary O
basic O
programs B
. O

didn't O
work B
when O
shipped O
from O
walmart O
. O
com O
but O
went O
into O
a O
store O
and O
exchanged O
for O
a O
working O
laptop O
same O
make O
model O
. O

it O
is O
so O
much O
fun O
to O
play O
with O
. O

if O
this O
is O
an O
improvement O
in O
customer O
service O
then O
i O
would O
hate O
too O
see O
what O
it O
was O
before O
! O

6th O
week O
they O
are O
not O
responding O
to O
my O
emails O
asking O
when O
they O
expect O
to O
dispatch O
the O
new O
unit O
. O
. O
. O

all O
of O
the O
programs B
keynote O
, O
pages O
, O
numbers O
have O
an O
option O
to O
save O
your O
documents O
as O
microsoft O
compatible O
, O
which O
really O
eliminates O
the O
need O
for O
the O
actual O
. O

sure O
, O
the O
initial O
out O
of O
pocket O
expense B
is O
greater O
, O
but O
that O
should O
not O
dissuade O
anyone O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
these O
machines O
run B
like O
none O
other O
on O
the O
planet O
, O
and O
when O
i O
factor O
in O
all O
the O
money O
in O
that O
i O
wasted O
on O
geek O
squad O
and O
the O
latest O
patches O
to O
de O
corrupt O
my O
infested O
pcs O
, O
it O
probably O
comes O
out O
about O
even O
anyhow O
. O

the O
best O
thing O
to O
do O
is O
build O
your O
own O
computer O
, O
but O
if O
u O
can't O
company's O
like O
dell O
who O
allow O
you O
to O
choose O
the O
components B
are O
better O
and O
for O
the O
same O
price B
you O
can O
get O
a O
computer O
who O
compares O
to O
one O
of O
apple O
<number> O
systems O
and O
if O
you O
google O
dell O
coupons O
you O
can O
find O
codes O
that O
take O
a O
signifant O
amount O
off O
the O
price B
. O

there O
is O
no O
cd B
drive B
on O
the O
computer O
, O
which O
defeats O
the O
purpose O
of O
keeping O
files O
on O
a O
cd B
. O

and O
toshiba O
is O
a O
quality O
supplier O
. O

for O
me O
i O
was O
lucky O
and O
a O
local O
store O
was O
selling O
them O
for O
<number> O
off O
and O
best O
buy O
matched O
their O
price B
so O
i O
was O
able O
to O
buy O
one O
for O
under O
<number> O

i O
can't O
honestly O
say O
i O
was O
heartbroken O
. O

will O
not O
every O
buy O
another O
lou O

unfortunately O
, O
apple's O
quality B
has O
continued O
to O
slide O
. O

and O
finally O
i O
realized O
that O
mac O
is O
the O
best O
. O

it's O
very O
annoying O
. O

i'm O
hoping O
that O
i O
can O
find O
a O
really O
quick O
way O
to O
clean O
it O
without O
it O
getting O
too O
gross O
. O

my O
only O
other O
complaint O
is O
that O
it O
gets O
really O
hot O
. O

i O
believe O
that O
the O
quality B
of O
a O
mac O
is O
worth O
the O
price B
. O

i'm O
very O
disappointed O
in O
dell O
. O

sometimes O
you O
will O
be O
moving O
your O
finger O
and O
the O
pointer B
will O
not O
even O
move O
. O

i've O
only O
had O
mine O
a O
day O
but O
i'm O
already O
used O
to O
it O
. O
. O
. O

and O
that O
was O
the O
fourth O
time O
ive O
sent O
it O
to O
them O
to O
get O
fixed O
. O

the O
<number> O
macbook O
pro O
just O
fits O
in O
my O
budget B
and O
with O
free O
shipping B
and O
no O
tax O
to O
ca O
this O
is O
the O
best O
price B
we O
can O
get O
for O
a O
great O
product O
. O

i O
would O
rate O
this O
computer O
at O
<number> O
stars O
, O
but O
considering O
it O
has O
a O
short O
life B
span B
i O
can O
only O
give O
it O
<number> O
and O
implore O
anyone O
looking O
at O
laptops O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
this O
machine O
. O

i O
also O
love O
the O
design B
, O
the O
looks B
, O
the O
feel B
, O
and O
the O
my B
toshiba B
feature B
is O
wonderfull O
. O

for O
me O
, O
five O
stars O
is O
not O
enough O
. O

i O
love O
how O
easy O
every O
thing O
is O
to O
do O
on O
my O
apple O
products O
. O

sadly O
apple O
has O
discontinued O
this O
macbook O
, O
i O
think O
it O
was O
never O
super O
popular O
since O
it O
fell O
somewhere O
in O
between O
the O
cheapest O
white O
model O
and O
the O
smaller O
pros O
. O

the O
layout B
of O
the O
macbook O
is O
horrible O
and O
confusing O
; O

was O
not O
happy O
with O
one B
of B
the B
programs B
on O
it O
. O

also O
it O
is O
very O
good O
for O
college O
students O
who O
just O
need O
a O
reliable O
, O
easy O
to O
use B
computer O
. O

the O
first O
one O
sent O
touchpad O
didn't O
work O
the O
second O
sent O
usb O
didn't O
work O
the O
third O
sent O
touchpad O
didn't O
work O
the O
fourth O
sent O
hasn't O
arrived O
yet O
. O

i O
came O
from O
the O
dell O
laptops O
and O
now O
i O
am O
so O
glad O
i O
switched O
when O
i O
needed O
a O
new O
laptop O
. O

this O
is O
definitely O
a O
computer O
worth O
the O
money O
; O

only O
other O
thing O
is O
that O
if O
you O
are O
using O
this O
for O
document B
creation B
apple O
doesnt O
provide O
any O
kind O
of O
word B
processor B
such O
as O
works O
for O
windows B
, O
but O
iwork B
is O
cheap O
compared O
to O
office B
. O

i O
am O
stuck O
with O
a O
laptop O
that O
i O
cannot O
do O
very O
much O
with O
. O

it O
is O
light O
and O
the O
battery B
last O
a O
very O
long O
time O
. O

better O
stick O
with O
another O
brand O
. O

i O
am O
glad O
i O
did O
my O
research O
. O

and O
at O
one O
point O
, O
they O
blame O
me O
for O
installing O
a O
bad O
memory B
stick B
when O
i O
upgrade O
my O
memory B
for O
the O
first O
time O
during O
my O
purchase O
of O
the O
laptop O
i O
bought O
the O
memory B
stick B
they O
recomended O
. O

<number> O
months O
dead O
again O
. O

also O
, O
you O
won't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
them O
going O
onlne O
a O
getting O
a O
virus O
. O

very O
happy O
. O

the O
netbook O
is O
easier O
for O
me O
to O
take O
to O
bed O
and O
carry O
around O
with O
me O
. O

externally O
the B
keys B
on O
my O
keyboard B
are O
falling O
off O
, O
after O
a O
few O
uses O
the B
paint B
is O
rubbing O
off O
the B
button B
below B
the B
mouse B
pad B
and O
where O
the B
heals O
of O
my O
hands O
sit O
, O
and O
the B
screen B
has O
a O
terrible O
glare O
. O

my O
children O
won't O
even O
use O
it O
for O
their O
school O
work O
. O

this O
laptop O
was O
bad O
from O
the O
first O
day O
of O
use O
brought O
it O
back O
to O
store O
for O
return O
of O
money O
. O

the O
next O
time O
i O
had O
an O
issue O
my O
lightscribe B
wouldn't O
work O
. O

the O
touchpad B
is O
extremely O
sensitive O
, O
which O
is O
the O
only O
drawback O
. O

also O
it O
comes O
with O
very O
useful O
applications B
like O
iphoto B
that O
it O
is O
the O
best O
photo B
application B
i O
have O
ever O
had O

it O
has O
everything O
i O
would O
need O
for O
a O
home O
computer O
. O

the O
computer O
did O
what O
it O
was O
not O
supposed O
to O
do O
, O
and O
i O
didn't O
know O
what O
to O
do O
. O
. O
. O
. O

i O
love O
this O
computer O
. O

they O
informed O
me O
that O
i O
had O
around O
<number> O
policies O
or O
viruses O
on O
it O
. O

they O
don O
t O
translate O
from O
a O
mac O
, O
even O
on O
word O
, O
resulting O
in O
a O
ton O
of O
run O
on O
sentences O
. O

the O
acer O
one O
computer O
that O
i O
bought O
is O
<number> O
ince B
screen B
and O
its O
hard O
to O
find O
lap O
top O
bags O
for O
it O
, O
but O
i O
like O
the O
big O
screen B
on O
it O
. O

summary O
they O
played O
games O
with O
me O
for O
the O
warranty B
period B
. O

i O
cant O
believe O
hp O
put O
this O
out O
. O

in O
november O
my O
computer O
messed O
up O
entirely O
and O
wouldn't O
power O
on O
after O
intalling O
a O
windows O
update B
, O
i O
had O
to O
have O
my O
hd O
flashed O
and O
lost O
everything O
on O
it O
, O
including O
my O
school O
assignments O
and O
irriplaceable O
pictures O
that O
were O
only O
in O
digital O
format O
and O
several O
other O
things O
, O
when O
this O
update B
was O
installed O
for O
some O
reason O
i O
was O
unable O
to O
roll O
back O
the O
drivers B
and O
everything O
to O
an O
earlier O
working O
condition O
because O
when O
the O
update B
was O
installed O
it O
deleted O
my O
history O
. O

without O
a O
big O
ol' O
clunky O
machine O
in O
my O
backpack O
, O
i O
feel O
like O
i O
can O
do O
programming O
homework O
anywhere O
. O

i O
can O
have O
both O
osx O
and O
windows O
xp O
running O
at O
the O
same O
time O
! O

i O
tell O
everyone O
that O
i O
know O
, O
friends O
, O
family O
and O
enemies O
this O
is O
the O
absolute O
worst O
computer O
i O
have O
ever O
used O
. O

overall O
poor O
, O
features O
average O
, O
performance O
poor O
, O
battery O
life O
excellent O
, O
price O
value O
poor O

otherwise O
, O
i O
love O
it O
! O

having O
someone O
give O
you O
a O
quick O
tour O
of O
how O
to's O
is O
the O
best O
. O

i O
have O
recently O
converted O
back O
to O
a O
mac O
and O
i O
couldn't O
be O
happier O
! O

microsoft O
seems O
to O
be O
unable O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
repairs O
for O
the O
multitude O
of O
windows B
problems O
. O

at O
<number> O
months O
it O
started O
shutting O
off O
after O
only O
<number> O
or O
<number> O
minutes O
. O

they O
basically O
told O
me O
that O
the O
machine O
would O
be O
problem O
free O
now O
. O

i O
paid O
about O
<number> O
for O
this O
laptop O
because O
of O
all O
the O
bells O
and O
whistles O
and O
it O
kept O
crapping O
out O
on O
me O
. O

the O
graphics B
are O
stunning O
. O

i O
found O
a O
2gb O
stick O
for O
a O
bit O
under O
<number> O
nice O
and O
portable O
and O
definitely O
a O
decent O
enough O
system B
to O
keep O
you O
entertained O
while O
sitting O
in O
the O
airplane O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
, O
or O
at O
the O
hotel O
taking O
care O
of O
some O
last O
minute O
details O
and O
documents O
. O

after O
much O
effort O
and O
<number> O
days O
asus O
replaced O
itthe O
wifi O
is O
very O
weak O
. O

you O
can O
call O
hp O
and O
they O
want O
you O
to O
buy O
more O
software B
to O
fix O
it O
. O

it O
has O
been O
plagued O
with O
problems O
since O
the O
day O
i O
turned O
it O
on O
. O

this O
computer O
is O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
any O
pc O
but O
it O
will O
last O
you O
longer O
and O
it O
worth O
every O
penny O
. O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
navigate B
and O
update B
programs B
. O

the O
laptop O
is O
gorgeous O
. O

it's O
more O
expensive O
but O
well O
worth O
it O
in O
the O
long O
run O
. O

i'm O
making O
the O
switch O
and O
finding O
that O
my O
biggest O
problem O
is O
trying O
to O
do O
things O
the O
'old' O
way O
and O
apple O
does O
, O
indeed O
, O
have O
the O
better O
idea O
. O

i've O
had O
hp O
desktop O
for O
over O
<number> O
yrs O
now O
and O
not O
one O
days O
goes O
by O
that O
i O
don't O
regret O
buying O
it O
. O

hp O
didn't O
fix O
it O
. O

, O
applications B
respond O
immediately O
not O
like O
the O
tired O
ms O
applications B
. O

all O
in O
all O
, O
a O
very O
disappointing O
experience O
except O
that O
i O
learned O
how O
good O
the O
geek O
squad O
is O
and O
also O
customer O
service O
. O

now O
, O
i O
guess O
, O
i'll O
have O
to O
unload O
my O
m6809 O
on O
some O
poor O
, O
hapless O
soul O
. O

the O
only O
drawback O
for O
me O
is O
how O
dirty O
the O
screen B
gets O
, O
and O
rather O
quickly O
too O
. O

the O
laptop O
is O
very O
lightweight O
, O
can O
easily O
carry B
around O
in O
a O
knapsack O
full O
of O
text O
books O
and O
it O
barely O
adds O
any O
weight B
. O

seems O
to O
slow O
down O
occassionally O
but O
can O
run O
many O
applications B
ie O
internet O
tabs B
, O
programs B
, O
etc O
simultaneously O
. O

the O
problems O
started O
with O
just O
the O
screen O
freezing O
. O

taking O
it O
anywhere O
was O
a O
pain O
! O

i O
also O
did O
not O
like O
the B
loud O
noises B
it O
made O
or O
how O
the B
bottom B
of B
the B
computer B
would O
get O
really O
hot O
. O

i O
had O
in O
the O
past O
a O
dell O
laptop O
and O
they O
sent O
me O
the O
items O
it O
needed O
or O
they O
sent O
a O
repair B
technician B
to O
my O
house O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

i O
previously O
owned O
a O
toshiba O
and O
it O
only O
lasted O
about O
<number> O
years O
. O

i O
can't O
imagine O
my O
life O
without O
it O
anymore O
! O

defective O
software B
. O

this O
computer O
was O
so O
challenging O
to O
carry B
and O
handle B
. O

cords B
coming O
out O
the O
right O
for O
power B
plus O
cords B
coming O
out O
front O
for O
headphones B
mic B
plus O
network B
connection B
on O
left O
make O
for O
a O
very O
messy O
setup B
with O
cords B
going O
every O
direction O
. O

unless O
you O
want O
to O
be O
inconvenienced O
with O
a O
non O
working O
power B
supply B
which O
you O
can't O
find O
a O
replacement O
for O
because O
they O
made O
the O
attachment O
so O
small O
. O

it O
is O
much O
faster O
than O
my O
desktop O
which O
is O
a O
core2 O
quad O
running O
at O
<number> O
. O
<number> O
ghz O
. O

it O
is O
good O
to O
know O
that O
i O
can O
mobilize O
without O
having O
to O
worry O
about O
the O
battery B
life B
. O

i O
baby O
my O
electronics O
so O
i O
know O
for O
a O
fact O
it O
was O
defective O
and O
not O
anything O
that O
i O
did O
to O
it O
. O

the O
screen B
is O
nice O
, O
side O
view O
angles O
are O
pretty O
good O
. O

the O
fact O
that O
the O
screen B
reacts O
to O
the O
lighting O
around O
you O
is O
an O
added O
luxury O
when O
you O
are O
working O
around O
others O
in O
dark O
areas O
and O
want O
privacy O
or O
don't O
want O
to O
bother O
them O
with O
bright O
lighting O
, O
it O
is O
very O
convenient O
to O
have O
a O
darker O
, O
softer O
lit O
screen B
. O

<number> O
weeks O
went O
by O
and O
the O
computer O
keeps O
crashing O
and O
will O
not O
open O
any O
applications B
. O

not O
to O
mention O
sometimes O
the O
whole O
charger B
unit B
will O
decide O
not O
to O
work O
entirely O
. O

looks O
nice O
, O
but O
has O
a O
horribly O
cheap O
feel B
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
not O
buying O
this O
product O
. O

its O
more O
like O
a O
snail O
crawl O
. O

i O
have O
other O
computers O
that O
get O
strong O
signals B
that O
don't O
drop O
in O
places O
that O
this O
net O
book O
loses O
its O
signal B
. O

the O
feel B
of O
this O
is O
better O
than O
the O
toshiba O
, O
too O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
to O
anyone O
looking O
to O
get O
a O
new O
laptop O
who O
is O
willing O
to O
spend O
a O
little O
more O
money O
to O
get O
great O
quality B
! O

i O
upgraded O
the O
memory B
and O
replaced O
the O
base O
windows O
<number> O
starter O
to O
win O
<number> O
home O
, O
and O
it O
runs B
just O
fine O
. O

i O
am O
not O
sure O
if O
it O
was O
the O
drive B
itself O
, O
however O
; O

so O
i O
called O
, O
again O
. O

also O
, O
one O
of O
the O
users O
mentioned O
how O
the O
edges B
on O
the O
macbook O
is O
sharp O
, O
if O
you O
have O
money O
to O
spend O
on O
one O
of O
the O
incase B
shells B
, O
it O
doesn't O
seem O
to O
be O
a O
problem O
. O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
use B
, O
its O
keyboard B
easily O
accommodates O
large O
hands O
, O
and O
its O
weight B
is O
fantasic O
. O

called O
acer O
many O
times O
, O
they O
want O
me O
to O
pay O
the O
shipping B
to O
ship O
it O
to O
their O
repair B
center B
i O
was O
very O
disappointed O
since O
it O
is O
a O
brand O
new O
computer O
! O

i O
was O
constantly O
having O
to O
roll O
back O
the O
computer O
after O
doing O
updates O
. O

stay O
away O
from O
envy O
. O

got O
it O
back O
<number> O
months O
later O

i O
have O
had O
to O
send O
in O
my O
laptop O
three O
times O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
. O

when O
i O
turned O
it O
on O
, O
nothing O
. O

i O
should O
have O
checked O
this O
before O
i O
installed O
my O
applications B
. O

the O
battery B
is O
really O
long O
. O

anyway O
, O
in O
early O
july O
of O
this O
year O
, O
the O
dvd O
burner B
stopped O
working O
, O
and O
the O
computer O
stared O
having O
issues O
with O
power B
supply B
. O

had O
some O
trouble O
finding O
a O
case B
that O
it O
would O
fit O
in O
. O

the O
<number> O
in O

has O
been O
a O
wonderful O
addition O
. O

this O
computer O
that O
i O
have O
has O
had O
issues O
with O
the O
keyboard B
where O
it O
lost O
half O
the O

functions B
. O

1st O
time O
they O
got O
it O
working O
the O
next O
<number> O
month O
they O
had O
me O
send O
it O

just O
love O
my O

not O
even O

my O

after O
only O
<number> O
months O

they O
freeze O
all O
the O
time O
. O

this O
one O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
might O
be O
a O
lemon O
! O

the O
book O
is O
useless O
. O

computer O
has O
been O
at O
service O
facility O
more O
than O
in O
my O
hands O
. O

this O
laptop O
is O
very O
large O
and O
barely O
fits O
in O
any O
carrying O
cases O
. O

when O
i O
called O
sony O
the O
customer O
service O
was O
great O
. O

even O
though O
i O
had O
the O
receipt O
in O

of O
me O
proving O
it O
still O
had O
<number> O
months O
left O
on O
the O

i O
sent O
it O
to O
them O
to O
fix O
in O
perfect O
condition O
but O
for O
what O
was O
wrong O
with O
it O
. O

it O
is O
a O
much O
more O
streamlined O
system B
for O
adding O
programs B
, O
using B
the B
internet B
, O
and O
doing O
other O
things O
everyone O
does O
on O
a O

my O
computer O
froze O
on O
several O
occasion O
, O
had O
buttons B
that O
randomely O
would O
fall O
off O
and O
even O
had O
moments O
when O
the O

would O
refuse O
to O
turn O
on O
at O
all O
. O

not O
even O
safe B

which O
was O
way O
too O

to O
those O

about O

then O
after O

i O
was O
forced O
to O
go O
out O

buy O
new O
hardware B

to O
keep O
this O

one O
year O
of O
trying O

fix O
the O
computer O
by O
myself O
, O
with O

even O
help O
from O

experts O
i O
have O
given O
up O
on O
trying O
to O
fix O
it O

as O
usual O
at O
customer B

she O
asked O
me O
to O
hold O
for O
a O
moment O
while O
she O
went O
to O
the O
back O
office O
and O
compare O
it O
with O
other O
same O
model O
netbooks O
and O
discussed O
it O
with O
her O
colleague O
i O
could O
see O
them O
. O

the O
screen B
gets O
smeary O
and O
dusty O
very O
quickly O
and O
it's O
very O
noticeable O

it O
all O
just O
makes O
sense O

i O
love O
it O
so O
much O

i O
got O
it O
for O

bad O

you O
can't O
even O
get O
a O
satellite B
card B
which O
is O
why O
i O
bought O
to O
begin O
with O

i O
use O
it O
now O
more O

even O
thought O

the O

, O
before O
the O
battery B
completely O
died O
of O

, O
left O
much O
to O
be O
desired O

do O
yourself O
a O

this O
is O
not O
a O
fake O
story O
trying O
to O

it O
is O
a O
real O

the O
toy O
i O
saw O
in O
other O
brands O
. O

it O
has O
worked O
fine O
. O

the O
most O
amazing O
part O
to O
me O
as O
a O
pc O
user O
is O
the O
startup O
and O
shutdown O
times O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
very O
rarely O
have O
to O
restart O
the O
thing O
. O

long O
story O
, O
but O
after O
many O
calls O
to O
various O
offices O
, O
i O
was O
told O
that O
no O
one O
can O
override O
the O
depot B
and O
that O
managers O
don't O
take O
phone O
calls O
or O
e O
mails O
. O

i O
can O
throw O
anything O
at O
it O
and O
i O
do O
, O
pictures O
, O
video O
editing O
, O
schoolwork O
. O

price O
and O
purpose O
is O
awesome O
! O

wonderful O
zooming B
. O

the O
screen B
is O
huge O
and O
coloful O
, O
but O
no O
led O
backlighting O
. O

the O
two O
of O
us O
use O
it O
regularly O
. O

in O
all O
honesty O
, O
if O
someone O
is O
looking O
for O
a O
quality O
laptop O
and O
willing O
to O
pay O
a O
little O
more O
money O
for O
a O
normal O
sized B
laptop O
than O
a O
cheaper O
and O
less O
impressive O
laptop O
, O
then O
do O
not O
buy O
this O
computer O
. O

everything O
about O
this O
computer O
is O
easy O
to O
use B
. O

after O
paying O
over O
<number> O
for O
this O
computer O
, O
it O
was O
not O
worth O
it O
. O

worse O
, O
for O
the O
price B
i O
could O
get O
a O
netbook O
that O
outperforms O
this O
machine O
. O

very O
happy O
with O
my O
7th O
toshiba O
laptop O
! O

my O
wife O
recently O
purchased O
an O
apple O
macbook O
pro O
and O
our O
granddaughter O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
it O
and O
asked O
for O
one O
for O
her O
birthday O
. O

it O
had O
most O
of O
the O
features B
and O
all O
of O
the O
power B
that O
i O
wanted O
to O
replace O
my O
desktop O
machine O
. O

keyboard O
was O
also O
very O
nice O
and O
had O
a O
solid O
feel O
. O

i O
will O
only O
buy O
apple O
laptops O
from O
now O
on O
. O

i O
would O
definitely O
suggest O
this O
laptop O
! O

it O
did O
not O
have O
all O
the O
features B
i O
expected O
it O
to O
have O
. O

just O
a O
bunch O
of O
idiots O
who's O
english O
as O
a O
5th O
language O
is O
forced O
at O
best O
. O

no O
luck O
, O
although O
i O
waited O
for O
hours O
on O
the O
phone O
visited O
machouse O
, O
they O
stated O
the O
their O
call B
center B
is O
down O
due O
to O
too O
many O
phonecalls O
difficult O
to O
believe O
. O

there O
is O
a O
backlit B
keyboard B
which O
is O
perfect O
for O
typing O
in O
the O
dark O
. O

it O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
memory B
and O
a O
great O
battery B
life B
. O

i O
spoke O
with O
a O
service B
rep B
at O
micro O
center O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
is O
having O
the O
same O
problem O
with O
her O
power B
adapter B
, O
so O
it's O
not O
just O
an O
isolated O
incident O
! O
! O
! O

they O
had O
me O
send O
in O
the O
machine O
last O
april O
returned O
it O
to O
me O
in O
may O
with O
no O
documentation O
on O
what O
was O
done O
it O
anything O
. O

<number> O
cut O
my O
losses O
and O
sold O
it O
for O
parts O

all O
i O
can O
say O
is O
w O
o O
w O
. O

i O
love O
this O
program B
, O
it O
is O
superior O
to O
windows B
movie B
maker B
. O

which O
is O
what O
i O
did O
, O
check O
out O
my O
acer O
<number> O
! O

he O
has O
replaced O
his O
hard B
drive B
twice O
and O
of O
course O
has O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
antivirus B
software B
every O
year O
. O

this O
purchase O
opened O
me O
to O
the O
world O
of O
macbooks O
, O
and O
i O
am O
impressed O
with O
the O
intuition O
of O
the O
design B
, O
the O
beauty B
of O
the O
product O
, O
and O
the O
excellent O
technological O
advances O
associated O
with O
it O
. O

i O
have O
loved O
this O
since O
i O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
. O

the O
price B
is O
great O
for O
this O
model O
, O
i O
only O
plan O
on O
using O
it O
for O
media O
in O
the O
entertainment O
room O
. O

it O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
very O
nice O
laptop O
except O
i O
was O
not O
able O
to O
load O
my O
garmin O
gps O
software B
or O
microsoft O
office O
<number> O
. O

but O
, O
like O
i O
said O
before O
, O
the O
only O
reason O
i O
don't O
currently O
have O
a O
mac O
laptop O
is O
because O
all O
of O
their O
laptops O
are O
too O
pricey O
. O

i've O
also O
had O
to O
have O
the O
keyboard B
replaced O
at O
my O
expense O
. O

i O
had O
the O
staff B
telling O
me O
older O
version O
did O
not O
make O
the O
fan B
noise B
cause O
it O
is O
a O
different O
computer O
. O

was O
very O
much O
worth O
the O
price B
i O
paid O
. O

so O
far O
, O
so O
good O
. O

even O
out O
of O
warranty B
! O

a O
tip O
for O
people O
looking O
into O
this O
computer O
do O
not O
buy O
it O
save O
up O
a O
bit O
more O
money O
and O
buy O
a O
computer O
that O
will O
last O
. O

this O
is O
a O
great O
little O
computer O
for O
the O
price B
. O

this O
comes O
in O
very O
handy O
for O
me O
as O
an O
educator O
. O

crisp O
screen B
, O
great O
battery B
life B
, O
and O
plenty O
of O
storage B
. O

it's O
a O
long O
and O
tirring O
process O
that O
after O
a O
while O
it O
seems O
like O
their O
game O
plan O
was O
to O
wear O
you O
out O
so O
you O
would O
want O
to O
give O
up O
on O
contacting O
them O
. O

all O
apple B
associates B
are O
always O
wiling O
to O
help O
you O
out O
with O
anything O
, O
no O
matter O
when O
you O
purchased O
the O
computer O
and O
how O
many O
years O
passed O
. O

i O
was O
waiting O
for O
this O
model O
to O
be O
released O
since O
january O
, O
and O
have O
been O
holding O
off O
on O
buying O
a O
macbook O
pro O
until O
the O
new O
model O
came O
out O
. O

i O
will O
never O
buy O
another O
hp O
computer O
. O

so O
i O
would O
not O
reccomend O
anyone O
buying O
this O
computer O

you O
will O
regret O
it O
if O
you O
buy O
any O
dell O
. O

i O
think O
that O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
durrable O
laptop O
then O
this O
is O
the O
way O
to O
go O
. O

also O
, O
my O
sister O
got O
the O
exact O
same O
laptop O
since O
they O
were O
so O
cheap O
and O
after O
<number> O
months O
, O
the O
screen B
split O
in O
half O
just O
from O
everyday O
use O
. O

it O
started O
out O
getting O
hot O
after O
only O
a O
few O
months O
. O

the O
toshiba O
satellite O
has O
been O
more O
than O
i O
expected O
for O
the O
price B
. O

i O
had O
to O
adjust O
my O
mousepad B
sensitivity B
, O
because O
it O
is O
very O
sensitive O
. O

i O
wish O
iwork O
or O
ms O
office O
came O
with O
the O
mac O
, O
but O
ms O
office O
doesn't O
even O
come O
with O
most O
pc O
laptops O
. O

to O
my O
mind O
much O
more O
usable O
than O
the O
toy O
called O
an O
ipad O
. O

it O
allows O
me O
to O
do O
everything O
i O
need O
from O
a O
computer O
and O
more O
. O

the O
best O
thing O
is O
even O
while O
doing O
almost O
ten O
or O
twenty O
things O
at O
once O
, O
it O
never O
slows O
down O
. O

keyboard O
is O
plastic O
and O
spongey O
feeling O
. O

, O
which O
apple O
doesn't O
offer O
, O
is O
why O
i O
bought O
my O
macbook O
at O
best O
buy O
. O

previous O
laptops O
were O
pc's O
, O
still O
have O
them O
, O
but O
the O
mac B
osx B
is O
a O
clean O
and O
smooth O
operating B
system B
. O

the O
computer O
is O
a O
dream O
come O
true O
. O

i O
also O
love O
having O
the O
extra O
calculator O
number O
set O
up O
on O
the O
keyboard B
which O
most O
laptops O
do O
not O
have O
. O

i'm O
glad O
i O
made O
the O
choice O
to O
switch O
and O
buy O
this O
mac O
. O

because O
he O
said O
that O
the O
hinge B
is O
under O
the O
motherboard B
and O
they O
have O
to O
dismantle O
the O
whole O
thing O
before O
it O
can O
be O
tightened O
. O

you O
can O
do O
it O
all O
on O
this O
bad O
boy O
but O
the B
main O
thing O
this O
netbook O
was O
desinged O
for O
was O
surfing B
the B
web B
and O
boy O
o O
boy O
does O
it O
ever O
. O

i O
love O
my O
apple O
, O
it O
is O
quick O
and O
easy O
to O
use B
. O

i O
took O
it O
to O
the O
shop O
and O
they O
said O
it O
would O
cost O
too O
much O
to O
repair O
it O
. O

didn't O
expect O
to O
repair O
it O
at O
once O
! O

it O
is O
quiet O
and O
a O
real O
joy O
to O
watch O
work O
. O

with O
notes O
saying O
they O
replaced O
the O
hard B
drive B
. O

the O
laptop O
is O
relatively O
simple O
to O
use B
, O
though O
i O
bought O
macs O
for O
dummies O
, O
which O
is O
well O
worth O
<number> O

can't O
close O
the O
2nd O
hdd O
bay B
since O
there O
are O
brackets O
you O
have O
to O
break O
off O
even O
then O
, O
it O
still O
doesn't O
shut O
that O
could O
be O
a O
major O
flaw O
for O
the O
dual O
hdd O
user O
. O

from O
the O
start O
, O
when O
you O
open O
the O
box O
you O
see O
a O
completely O
different O
class O
of O
machine O
. O

no O
tutorials B
on O
the O
display O
. O

the O
leather B
carrying B
case B
, O
keyboard B
and O
mouse B
arrived O
in O
two O
days O
from O
memphis O
warehouse O
. O

the O
touch B
pad B
is O
among O
the O
best O
. O

very O
very O
disappointed O
! O

if O
you O
are O
a O
person O
like O
me O
, O
more O
on O
the O
creative O
side O
, O
the O
mac O
has O
something O
for O
you O
too O
. O

i O
had O
to O
have O
these O
computers O
in O
my O
school O
. O

thus O
, O
when O
you O
carry O
it O
at O
a O
slanted O
angle O
, O
the O
screen B
will O
topple O
or O
slide O
down O
, O
if O
you O
understand O
what O
i O
mean O
. O

again O
. O

to O
this O
day O
, O
there O
are O
none O
. O

i O
setup O
my O
password O
last O
night O
with O
the O
password O
on O
my O
other O
computer O
. O

it O
is O
an O
amazing O
image O
and O
it O
too O
is O
holding O
up O
quite O
nicely O
to O
little O
hands O
grabbing O
the O
back O
of O
my O
laptop O
. O

first O
i O
have O
been O
searching O
for O
long O
time O
before O
i O
decided O
to O
get O
mac O
. O

it's O
now O
all O
commodity B
hardware B
. O

we O
also O
use O
paralles O
so O
we O
can O
run O
virtual O
machines O
of O
windows O

i O
was O
so O
excited O
when O
my O
dad O
said O
i O
could O
get O
a O
new O
laptop O
for O
my O
birthday O
. O

we O
purchased O
this O
as O
a O
back O
up O
computer O
after O
our O
more O
expensive O
hp O
needed O
to O
be O
repaired O
. O

they O
reported O
that O
the O
computer O
is O
in O
their O
headquarters O
. O

bought O
notebook O
<number> O
<number> O
. O

how O
toshiba O
handles O
the O
repair B
seems O
to O
vary O
, O
some O
folks O
indicate O
that O
they O
were O
charged O
for O
even O
an O
intial O
fix O
, O
others O
had O
the O
repair B
done O
<number> O
times O
. O

i O
would O
like O
to O
use O
a O
different O
operating B
system B
altogether O
. O

all O
of O
them O
were O
windows O
machines O
. O

well O
, O
i O
had O
completed O
the O
presentation O
in O
powerpoint O
the O
night O
before O
on O
my O
pc O
, O
but O
took O
the O
apple O
to O
the O
conference O
. O

the O
latest O
and O
mightiest O
macbook O
pro O
<number> O
inch O
was O
bought O
by O
my O
university O
on O
the O
30th O
of O
june O
<number> O
. O

i O
have O
a O
business O
website O
and O
every O
time O
i O
have O
to O
change O
something O
i O
have O
to O
go O
to O
the O
public O
library O
to O
use O
a O
pc O
. O

i O
paid O
about O
the O
same O
for O
my O
toshiba O
as O
i O
did O
for O
the O
compaq O
a O
few O
years O
back O
. O

this O
was O
an O
update O
from O
an O
early O
macbook O
pro O
. O

i O
think O
i O
might O
rather O
suffer O
for O
something O
that O
is O
simple O
to O
fix O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O
